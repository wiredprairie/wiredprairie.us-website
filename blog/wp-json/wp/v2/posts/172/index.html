From his post:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The above example is a bit of a special case, and I don&#8217;t feel bad about it at all.&nbsp; A much greater struggle that hits a very large number of users is how we do Control templating.&nbsp; All of the APIs we use in Silverlight&#8217;s Beta1 control templating model exist in desktop WPF, and yet the templates are completely different.&nbsp; By subsetting the APIs we ended up changing not just the best practices, but the essential model.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Let me be clear.&nbsp; If you write your own custom control in Silverlight, using the Silverlight model, you can create a template for it and take your custom control and its template and run them on desktop WPF.&nbsp; The problem is, we do not provide Triggers in Silverlight and many of the properties (IsMouseOver, IsPressed) that Triggers depend on to work.&nbsp; There are technical reasons Triggers were hard to add in Silverlight 2 (though we will add them in the future), but even greater was the test and development cost of adding all the additional properties necessary to make them work.&nbsp; So, we decided to make the controls have to &#8220;trigger&#8221; the state changes themselves in code.&nbsp; All this code works on desktop WPF.&nbsp; But existing controls, written for the desktop, don&#8217;t contain the code to &#8220;trigger&#8221; the state changes, so the control templates don&#8217;t do anything when applied (they create their children, but don&#8217;t react to events).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The more I consider this &#8230; the less I care about portability specifically between WPF and Silverlight. It&#8217;s unlikely that I&#8217;ll ever be able to use or need to use code exactly as it was written for a desktop WPF application (yes, there will be elements that are worth copying &#8212; but I believe that a full installed application should work differently from an enhanced web page with Silverlight). If I&#8217;m running a WPF app &#8212; I&#8217;m running a thick, rich, installed application (or click-once). If I&#8217;m writing something for Silverlight, I need to write code which lives within the confines of the browser. Although similar, they&#8217;re still quite different on many levels.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, I would like the models to be the same &#8212; if only because I&#8217;ve really become fond of many of the WPF features and techniques for building a user interface: triggers, triggers, and triggers. I can absolutely live without 3D and even without a full .NET framework. But triggers really help separate the UI from the code. I&#8217;ve done some investigation and I can&#8217;t see how I could create a reasonable approximation of Triggers without a lot of work &#8212; and even then it wouldn&#8217;t be compatible with WPF XAML. John said &#8220;when we add triggers&#8230;&#8221; &#8230;, so it gives me a bit of hope (albeit with no time tables&#8230;).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>John Gossman, architect of the WPF team (desktop and subset taht supplies UI framework for Silverlight), discusses a few of the pain points developers and designers are facing today with WPF to Silverlight portability.
