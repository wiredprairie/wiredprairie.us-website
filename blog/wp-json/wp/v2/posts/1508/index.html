Thankfully, it said that it had only been 17 minutes since it last connected. I\u2019ve seen that issue before and it usually resolves. But, I\u2019ve never seen one go more than about <strike>50<\/strike> 53 minutes without reporting in.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that I was using the iPad and the Nest application meant that WiFi Internet was available in our house. <\/p>\n<p>I went to the Basement thermostat and noticed this glaring issue after clicking through to settings:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/image24.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"226\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><font style=\"background-color: #ffff00\">What?<\/font>&#160; <\/strong>Seriously? <\/p>\n<p>As I wasn\u2019t sure what the best option was at 6:45AM for support, I decided to re-add the thermostat to our account. The thermostat had no trouble accessing the Nest cloud and obtaining one of the one time connection keys. (So, I maintain, it\u2019s not general Internet connectivity issues).<\/p>\n<p>After deleting and adding it back, the web site still reported it as MIA. So, I tried a reset:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/image25.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"228\" \/><\/p>\n<p>After resetting, and waiting several minutes after it had completely restarted, it appeared again on the Nest web site.<\/p>\n<p>However, 3 hours later:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/image26.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/image_thumb16.png\" width=\"318\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s again, gone missing. <\/p>\n<p>So, I called support this fine Sunday morning and talked to one of the same support engineers I\u2019ve spoken with in the past (\u201cDK\u201d). I explained the general problem (and emphasized that my biggest concern was that it had lost my account information), my \u201csolution\u201d, and said that it was again not reporting in. In a typical (somewhat ironic) support fashion, as I was explaining the issue and walking to the basement, the thermostat reported in successfully to the Nest cloud. <\/p>\n<p>He had me drop the account, add it to my account, and restart it again. He said that resolves the problem in about 70% of the cases. In the other 30%, he mentioned that they often manually update the firmware and that will help.
