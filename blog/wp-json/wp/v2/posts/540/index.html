We\u2019ve gone to this because it offers the greatest amount of protection for the images in a web environment. (Oh yeah, forgot to mention, might mess up RSS feeds too.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what he&#8217;s protecting exactly by using Flash for a tiny 350 pixel wide image? <\/p>\n<p>I totally respect his rights as a photographer &#8212; that he owns the pictures he&#8217;s taken and he doesn&#8217;t want others to use them. But, hiding them in Flash just makes the honest people more honest &#8230; if you want to steal the tiny image, it&#8217;s still REAALY easy to do.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve intentionally distorted the section of the blog containing the image and rotated it to show it&#8217;s so easy to do (I used SnagIt 9). It took me a total of 10 seconds to do the fancy work. It would have taken less if I just wanted to grab the bear.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/image21.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"193\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/image-thumb5.png\" width=\"173\" border=\"0\"\/><\/a>  <\/p>\n<p>(image and content owned by Moose &#8212; clipped here for editorial demonstration and distorted as an example)<\/p>\n<p>What impact does this have on me? Well, as suggested in the quote above, the new technique is causing my RSS Reader of choice (Google Reader) to not show any of his beautiful images. And that&#8217;s a big loss! <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d still recommend his web site and content nonetheless &#8230; but here&#8217;s to hoping he can find a better way to &#8220;protect&#8221; his images while retaining the ability for RSS readers to show the photography.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I enjoy Moose Peterson&#8217;s photography and blog.
