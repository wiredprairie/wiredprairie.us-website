While the setup nearly works, the final verification step for the wall controller always fails from the app. Further, and confusingly, if you look at the clients list in the Ubiquiti controller, it&#8217;s very likely that you&#8217;ll see the wall controller listed with a valid IP address. However, that&#8217;s not enough to make everything work as expected.<\/p>\n<p>There are two settings that seem to enable the wall controller to work properly. I discovered these after reading an article about setting up a <a href=\"https:\/\/help.ubnt.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360001004034-UniFi-Best-Practices-for-Managing-Chromecast-Google-Home-on-UniFi-Network\">Google Home\/Chromecast<\/a>.
