If you did a survey of 100 adults in the USA to name a board-game, I&#8217;d bet Monopoly would be number 1 on the list. Even McDonald&#8217;s for years has run various gaming promotions that involved the Monopoly brand. It&#8217;s ingrained in the culture. Let&#8217;s face it though: <strong>Monopoly isn&#8217;t for everyone<\/strong>.<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"https:\/\/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/e\/ir?t=wiredp-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000ITBYU8\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" \/>\u00a0I think I enjoyed a game <em>one time<\/em>. But, I&#8217;m not sure we actually ever finished the game. Maybe that&#8217;s why I enjoyed it.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>There may be a few games of Monopoly still underway since 1935 when it was released.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Once you get beyond Monopoly, there&#8217;s the <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2g3YcWl\">Scrabble<\/a>s, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gsF8OE\">Clue<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gxrKd5\">Battleship<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2g3VRe4\">Risk<\/a>, and many more. We had many of those games in our home&#8217;s closet until recently. We looked at the stack of games, talked briefly, and donated them all to a local charity. They just don&#8217;t hold our interest anymore compared to the modern board game.<\/p>\n<p>As a child I was playing Risk with a cousin &#8230;, he got so unhappy with his bad-luck and my good-luck that he threw his dice at me as hard as he could. I hadn&#8217;t know I&#8217;d be at Risk (!!! :) ) for playing that. There are better games than Risk as far as I&#8217;m concerned.<\/p>\n<p>I played <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gvaAiG\">Axis and Allies<\/a>\u00a0(I think it was that\u00a0edition)\u00a0some in college and never got into it.\u00a0My group of friends\u00a0played it occasionally for a year or two; I played it very casually.\u00a0I played more &#8220;speed Axis and Allies&#8221; and friends played, &#8220;give me 20-30 minutes to consider my actions as the WORLD IS AT STAKE HERE.&#8221; \u00a0That experience turned me off to board games for the most part for a <strong>long time<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s changed a lot in the last 10 years. There are thousands of great games in a wide variety of genre these days at all price points.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;ve included a handful of games which my wife and I consider great transitional games for someone who has tried (and either liked or disliked) the old-traditional board games. I&#8217;ve seen some lists recently that contain a few games that I&#8217;d definitely not consider transitional or starter games, so I was motivated to build my own list.<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2g3WcgR\">Ticket to Ride, Europe<\/a><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Days-of-Wonder-DOW-7202\/dp\/B000809OAO\/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480189526&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=ticket+to+ride+board+game&amp;linkCode=li3&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkId=9df75e4a4471acfbc67c67d726dd445d\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"\/\/ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/widgets\/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B000809OAO&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=wiredp-20\" width=\"237\" height=\"250\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"https:\/\/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/e\/ir?t=wiredp-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000809OAO\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2g3WcgR\">Ticket to Ride Europe<\/a>, by Days of Wonder, with over 3 million copies sold, is for 2-5 players and works well with 2-4 (I&#8217;ve not tried with 5). Games usually take about one hour and a little longer if people are learning to play.\u00a0It&#8217;s stand-alone and does not require a base set (<strong>be careful to note that some boxed Ticket to Ride games require a base set to play<\/strong>).<\/p>\n<p>The essential part of the game is that you&#8217;re building a hand of cards that eventually can be converted into rail lines for points. Most points at the end wins. It&#8217;s learn-able in 5 minutes or so on average and usually takes players a few rounds of play before they&#8217;re comfortable with the rules in action.<\/p>\n<p>For my USA based readers, you&#8217;ll see that there&#8217;s an edition of the United States and you might be inclined to buy that. Buy it if you&#8217;re playing with 4 people. But, if you&#8217;re playing with fewer people, I&#8217;d strongly suggest you try a smaller map, like Europe (as it&#8217;s stand-alone). You&#8217;ll find that it&#8217;s a more competitive game that way as you&#8217;ll be likely working to complete the same rail lines as the other players. Europe is great with 4 players.<\/p>\n<p>There are many <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gxsdMJ\">variations on Ticket to Ride <\/a>that \u00a0you might want to try as well.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s great about it is that while you can see the progress of other players, and occasionally unknowingly hinder their progress, it&#8217;s not necessarily obvious who will win the game until the end. There&#8217;s a bit of mystery as there are special cards called Destination Tickets in this edition of the game that are kept secret until the end of the game and may dramatically affect the score of individual players.<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gxqRBC\">Pandemic<\/a><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gxqRBC\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2134\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/index.php\/archives\/2124\/pandemic\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/pandemic.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 6s&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.2&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"pandemic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/pandemic-300x96.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/pandemic.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2134 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/pandemic.jpg\" alt=\"pandemic\" width=\"800\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/pandemic.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/pandemic-300x96.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/pandemic-768x246.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t prepared for a game that takes a little longer to learn, Pandemic may not be a good transitional game. You should give this one a chance though.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming you can get through the rules (which admittedly are more complex than those of Monopoly), you&#8217;ll enjoy this cooperative game with friends and family (ages 12+ probably is best). Nearly every game I&#8217;ve played has ended up as a close win or close loss. You often don&#8217;t know right until the end which leads to a lot of enthusiastic and sometimes overly dramatic play by the players (but that&#8217;s the fun!). As the pandemics spread across the map, it&#8217;s your job as a band of specialists to\u00a0reduce the spread, find the cure, and possibly eradicate the diseases entirely. The reason that I suggest this game is that it&#8217;s a great cooperative game. Everyone MUST play together or YOU WILL LOSE. Most of the games\u00a0I played as a child were &#8220;versus&#8221; or team games and so this game was an eye-opener for me. The game plays against us all?<\/p>\n<p>You might choose to ignore the thousands of positive reviews and instead look at the 1-star reviews on Amazon. <strong>Don&#8217;t<\/strong>. I honestly believe the folks that gave up on the game simply did not give it a fair chance or wanted to not learn it. If after reading the instructions, it&#8217;s still not clear, find one of the hundreds of walk-through videos that exist online. Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JeJQWrocQnY\">one<\/a> from the publisher. Here&#8217;s another from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ytK1zDPPDhw\">TableTop<\/a> where they play through an episode.<\/p>\n<p>Also, until you&#8217;re committed to this type of game, do not mistakenly buy <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2fzCPZm\">Pandemic Legacy<\/a>. Absolutely, it&#8217;s a FUN game; one that requires a commitment of at\u00a0least 12 plays to finish the game. It&#8217;s\u00a0best played by a group that is consistent from play to play (as it&#8217;s telling a story as it goes through so jumping in during the middle of the game won&#8217;t be as interesting or as engaging). I&#8217;ve only played through June so far, and having the back-story and experience of playing the early episodes is really what makes that game top notch.<\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"https:\/\/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/e\/ir?t=wiredp-20&amp;l=li3&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00A2HD40E\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/boardgame\/197911\/onami\">Onami<\/a>\u00a0from Wyvern Gaming<\/h3>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"2131\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/index.php\/archives\/2124\/onami\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Onami.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"600,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 6s&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.2&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"onami\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Onami-300x225.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Onami.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2131 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Onami.jpg\" alt=\"onami\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Onami.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Onami-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a great reasonably quick game (under 30 minutes).

While the rules at first were a bit strange, it only took a few rounds of play to understand the basics.<\/p>\n<p>This is a tile laying game and ideally needs a large space in which to play as there&#8217;s not a traditional board like other games.

Some apparently have said it&#8217;s a puzzle game, but I don&#8217;t consider it puzzle-styled at all.

Everyone wins or loses. The difference here is that there is a player that comes out ahead of the others by score (victory points are counted by how many monsters are slain). It&#8217;s considered a tower-defense game. That just means that the monsters are attacking the castle and that it&#8217;s your job as a player to defend the tower (castle). Each turn players try to eliminate or push back the various monsters that are making their way to the tower.

It&#8217;s that easy.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.onehitkillgame.com\/#core\">It&#8217;s available direct via the publisher here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gt6FPL\">10 Days in Africa<\/a><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2flJFq2\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2133\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/index.php\/archives\/2124\/outofafrica\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/OutOfAfrica.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"600,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 6s&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.2&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;64&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"outofafrica\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/OutOfAfrica-300x225.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/OutOfAfrica.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2133 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/OutOfAfrica-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"outofafrica\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/OutOfAfrica-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/OutOfAfrica.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For two to four players, this quick game will challenge you to build a route between various countries in Africa. You&#8217;ll need to take a creative route that starts in one country and using land, water, and air travel plots a successful route to a final country. The rules and game play are simple. Plays in less than 30 minutes. My nine-year old nephew understood the game and the rules, but was stressed by the planning that was required (as he couldn&#8217;t see all of the options that might be available to him). So, consider it possibly better for slightly older children if they&#8217;re playing against older kids or adults.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are other countries, like <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2flLh32\">USA<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2fzPDyM\">Europe<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2flK7o1\">Asia, <\/a>and the <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2flDNwR\">Americas <\/a>available. You may have to hunt around for a copy of any of them though which is disappointing.<\/p>\n<h3>And Many many more!<\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to look around. <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2g4aEoZ\">Amazon <\/a>has literally tens of thousands of board game listings. <strong>Seriously<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Also, find your local board game store and stop by. HOWEVER, if you&#8217;ve never been to the board game store, make sure you call ahead or look at their website to confirm they have a variety of board game options. (Some cater to wargaming rather than board-gaming). My wife and I, when we visit a new city in the USA, always try to find a few local board game stores and stop in and buy a few small games to play on our vacation (and spread the board game love I guess a little). We&#8217;ve met some really interesting people doing that and gone to a few stores that were\u00a0<em>unique<\/em> to say the least (one in particular where we developed a case of claustrophobia walking through the overly packed and stacked boxes and aisles. Two people couldn&#8217;t fit down an aisle and it felt like it was all going to tumble on our heads!).<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the web site <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boardgamegeek.com\">Board Game Geek.com<\/a>, but for those new to board games, I&#8217;d suggest you stick to Amazon and your local stores. While it has a lot of great information, it&#8217;s often a bit intense for newcomers. :)<\/p>\n<p>I had a few more games that I&#8217;d intended to add here, but now that I search for them on the Internet, I see that they&#8217;re no longer published and they&#8217;re all hard to obtain. While you might enjoy the challenge of spending hours tracking down a copy, I&#8217;d suggest you buy a different board game and play that instead. So, I&#8217;m not going to list them today.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the best games tend to be available on Amazon and are well reviewed by hundreds and thousands of people.<\/p>\n<p>(Next , I&#8217;ll create a post\u00a0with\u00a0some of the cooperative games that I&#8217;ve enjoyed playing with my wife and friends and family).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Comments and feedback welcome!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the USA, there are some traditional board games that are\u00a0commonly found in the closets of many households.
