Our cars normally start without issue. Occasionally however, we&#8217;ve had a dead battery in an inopportune time or location and needed to call someone for a jump. Now, rather than carrying a giant jump battery in the car, we carry this.<\/p>\n<p>More frequently, I use it to jump start our riding lawn tractor that often has a depleted battery (that I&#8217;ve not been able to successfully troubleshoot). I&#8217;ve had this for more than a year and used it more than 6 times without any trouble (thankfully, I haven&#8217;t needed it more than that). The convenience of it is awesome.

And it should be for you too. This novel little light attaches securely to the rear of your bike helmet and self levels so that it&#8217;s always pointing vertically in a reasonable direction. While you could attach it to your bike, there are better and brighter lights available for your bike that I&#8217;d recommend instead. Use this as a secondary bike light. It&#8217;s lightweight. I don&#8217;t notice its there.

These simple and inexpensive (around $6) holders give me the confidence to wear my glasses in situations where I was concerned about them falling off my face.<\/p>\n<p>This was especially true while riding my bicycle. When I was looking down while riding (even for a moment to look at the GPS, etc.), I often had the distinct feeling that my glasses were sliding off my face. On hotter days, this was exacerbated by perspiration. No more! While I wouldn&#8217;t be brave (or dumb) enough to think that these would hold my glasses on while riding a loop on a modern roller-coaster, they perform well enough for more typical day-to-day sports. As you&#8217;ll see from their ratings, I&#8217;m not the only person that likes them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>They&#8217;re under $6.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"title\" class=\"a-size-large a-spacing-none a-color-secondary\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2gsEeW6\"><span id=\"productTitle\" class=\"a-size-large\">Shacke Hidden Travel Belt Wallet w\/ RFID Blocker<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00Z2AKO3G\/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=li2&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkId=7ce7b00b5c34a0d2d68c7b802b91a7d6\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"\/\/ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/widgets\/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00Z2AKO3G&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=wiredp-20\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"https:\/\/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/e\/ir?t=wiredp-20&amp;l=li2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00Z2AKO3G\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When traveling internationally, my wife and I always carry our passports on us while out and about (I know that some people leave them in the hotel room). I&#8217;ve tried a few different ways to carry my passport over the years, and this is my current favorite discrete carrying option. It&#8217;s lightweight and fits well in the front of one of your legs. Occasionally, you&#8217;ll notice it, but it&#8217;s not distracting. It&#8217;s got room for a few more things, but it&#8217;s not intended to carry everything; just stuff you don&#8217;t frequently need. I put spare cash, a paper map, and often our ATM card inside. Apparently, there were\/are gray wallets of this, but unless you have a gray belt, it will show. By the way, this definitely requires that you wear a belt and is about $16.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"title\" class=\"a-size-large a-spacing-none\"><a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2fzdBKv\"><span id=\"productTitle\" class=\"a-size-large\">Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II (Black)<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Canon-PowerShot-G7-Mark-Black\/dp\/B01BV14OXA\/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480183260&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=canon+gx+7+mark+ii&amp;linkCode=li2&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkId=a5d0ed707565c0f910c58767fc2c4c9f\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"\/\/ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/widgets\/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B01BV14OXA&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=wiredp-20\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"https:\/\/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/e\/ir?t=wiredp-20&amp;l=li2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B01BV14OXA\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure many of you have decided that your phone takes great pictures and that&#8217;s all that you need. Fine. I accept that you&#8217;re missing out. OK, seriously. Your smart phone probably does take some great pictures. But, some\u00a0images just can&#8217;t be captured by your smart phone. Occasionally, you&#8217;ll be able to walk closer to something you want to capture to emulate &#8220;zoom&#8221;, but often, you&#8217;ll find that the picture you captured isn&#8217;t the way you remembered it. This is where a nice point-and-shoot + more camera comes into play. I&#8217;ll take pictures when I&#8217;m on vacation with both this camera and my smart phone. I&#8217;m not going to bore you with a long list of features. That&#8217;s available on the web.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why I bought this model:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>RAW mode + JPEG<\/li>\n<li>Touch screen (tap to take a picture)<\/li>\n<li>Size \/ weight<\/li>\n<li>Pop-up flash<\/li>\n<li>Good battery life (definitely buy spare batteries though)<\/li>\n<li>Good bokeh (for a point-and-shoot)<\/li>\n<li>24-100mm zoom. Means I can take adjust zoom.<\/li>\n<li>Can attach to my tripod (or mini-tripod) and my Really Right Stuff equipment<\/li>\n<li>Easy to adjust f-stop\/aperture, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s by no means an inexpensive camera. However, I do not foresee any reason I&#8217;ll want or need to replace it any time soon. So, for now, I consider it a long term camera.<\/p>\n<p>I would strongly recommend you buy a backup battery, regardless of the camera you choose. I bought some cheaper replacement batteries, not from Canon. I bought the <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2fQjkN7\">DSTE NB-13L\u00a0<\/a>batteries. I bought 2 for 50% of the price of a Canon OEM battery. I&#8217;ll warn you, as does the camera when it detects these the first time, that these are not Canon batteries. You&#8217;ll need to acknowledge a warning that they are not\u00a0Original Canon Batteries.\u00a0They work fine though and I&#8217;ve not noticed any significant difference from the standard Canon batteries. They last a reasonable amount of time. Some combinations of extra batteries include an extra charger. Having lost a charger on my last trip to Finland, I was glad I&#8217;d brought a spare along.<\/p>\n<p>Also, so that I could use a quick release plate with my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reallyrightstuff.com\/\">Really Right Stuff<\/a> tripod ballhead, I bought a quick release L plate from Desmond. (I usually buy from Really Right Stuff, but they didn&#8217;t have a great inexpensive option for this camera).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00WOU7OT4\/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=li1&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkId=014dd68181f330136ae77f298a7267fa\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"\/\/ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/widgets\/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00WOU7OT4&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=wiredp-20\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"https:\/\/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/e\/ir?t=wiredp-20&amp;l=li1&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00WOU7OT4\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The model I bought fits the camera very well and is easy to attach and remove.

I had no idea how useful this would be. We bought it initially to protect a bunch of table-top board game cheat sheets we&#8217;d made or copied. We print them out on our inkjet on regular paper and then laminate them in a <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2g6Wgwt\">3 mil thermal laminating pouch<\/a>. The laminator takes 4-5 minutes to warm up at first so there&#8217;s no <em>instant gratification<\/em> that comes with it&#8217;s use. Once it heats though, you can feed sheets in with nearly wild abandon (there&#8217;s no reason to wait between sheets). In addition to the cheat sheets, we&#8217;ve protected copies of important travel and legal documents, copies of instructions (often that we want to hang near the equipment like our furnace or water filtration system). I&#8217;ve made small signs and placards for various events and even cleaning instructions for a few things around our house. The laminating pouches are often found in 3 and 5 mil.
