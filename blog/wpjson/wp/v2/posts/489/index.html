I see no reason to not have a full size version available as a single &#8220;click&#8221; or gesture, and thumbnail the image for the rest of us. Increase the font sizes of everything else on the screen, and hopefully return the small weather icons to a usable, again, at a glance size.<\/p>\n<p>How would you change the UI?
