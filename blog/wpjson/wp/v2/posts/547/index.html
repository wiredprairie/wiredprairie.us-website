But we\u2019re really trying to turn the software development problem into a data design\u2014that\u2019s the simplest way to talk about what we\u2019re doing. And so part of that premise is making it easy for people to interact with that data. And one way to interact with data is through visualizations and diagrammatic things, box and line designers, all kinds of charts.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Oh, I get it. It&#8217;s diagrams and stuff. :) And a software package that captures hope? That&#8217;s power.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be at PDC and probably see more about it, but I remain skeptical. <\/p>\n<p>How will they empower non-developers to build a distributed application? How will it efficiently access data and not thrash database servers with generated queries, etc.? Who is this marketed to? The article refers to business analysts? What kind of market will that be? Is it worth spending all this Microsoft brainpower on this problem? How does it interact with other languages (like .NET?). <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why a new language? Because to pull off the Oslo goal, \u201cwe needed a revolution in developer productivity,\u201d said Steven Lucco, a distinguished engineer in Microsoft\u2019s Developer Division who helped develop the vision for CSD and the Oslo effort.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It goes on &#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An Oslo user need not learn the D language to use Oslo, however. \u201cThe language is a technical detail for a certain audience,\u201d Lovering said.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>So, they needed a new language that the user doesn&#8217;t need. <\/p>\n<p>If Microsoft had taken a poll &#8212; is this what their bread and butter audience would have voted for? Would you? I&#8217;ll reserve final judgement until I see it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to Don Box, the best explanation of Oslo is here at eWeek. I read it.
