It only has 10 days of information available apparently right now, so I just can\u2019t see this being very useful. I\u2019m skeptical that this will affect my choices as it comes to how we use our HVAC system. I could see potentially how aggregate data of many users (in a similar geographical area) could become more compelling and potentially a source of data that Nest might be able to sell. <\/p>\n<p>The settings for a thermostat have been tweaked visually. The same basic data is available as before:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/image13.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/image_thumb3.png\" width=\"502\" height=\"215\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The learning tab has been cleaned up as well:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/image14.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/image_thumb4.png\" width=\"502\" height=\"202\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For some reason, our thermostat that we\u2019ve had for four months is apparently still in training (Time to Temp). That seems like an issue that maybe I\u2019ll look into. Although I don\u2019t really care much about the \u201ctime to temp\u201d feature normally as I don\u2019t manually adjust the affected thermostat much.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cAway\u201d tab changed:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/image15.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/image_thumb5.png\" width=\"502\" height=\"202\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Not a big improvement for usability. Probably more touch friendly (and it\u2019s logically correct as it heats when less than 58 degrees for example), but it feels wrong. Thermostats aren\u2019t normally left to right oriented (temp goes up and down), so this breaks a typical UX model. <\/p>\n<p>On the Equipment tab, they\u2019ve tweaked the UI as well:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/image16.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/image_thumb6.png\" width=\"502\" height=\"163\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><font style=\"style\">I clicked on the <strong>Safety Temp<\/strong> word (? it\u2019s not a button, nor a link, so I don\u2019t know what to call it) and the above UI displayed. The same temperature range UX is displayed, but here I like it even less. I suppose we don\u2019t have a maximum temperature in the house during cooling season, but this is clunky. (And given that it\u2019s safety related, I wish it were more clear). I can hear some of you say, \u201cbut it\u2019s clear to me.\u201d I do understand it, but I\u2019m confident there is a better way of displaying and adjusting these temperatures that would be more obvious.<\/font><\/p>\n<p>(And Nest Labs, go ahead and spell out \u201cTEMP\u201d please? Thanks!)<\/p>\n<p> The technical info tab is the same basically. <\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s now a lock feature (which I have no need for, and am not going to experiment with right now):<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/image17.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/image_thumb7.png\" width=\"502\" height=\"193\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One of the big new TM\u2019ed features is called <a href=\"http:\/\/support.nest.com\/customer\/portal\/articles\/453244-\">Airwave<\/a>\u2122. Apparently, when it\u2019s hot and the humidity is low (not typical for Wisconsin, as our summers are usually hot and humid), the thermostat apparently will try to do more cooling by turning off the air conditioning system early and using the fan more. (I always thought our air conditioner already did that as the compressor turns off before the fans). If it helps lower our electricity bill, awesome. I\u2019ll report back if I can tell that it is working and helping (without historical data though, it will be difficult for us, especially as we added solar panels to our house last fall).<\/p>\n<p>The scheduling tab looks basically unchanged. The support tab has more content, so you don\u2019t have to go to their web site to read the information. That\u2019s a nice improvement.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><font style=\"style\">OK, this was very strange.
