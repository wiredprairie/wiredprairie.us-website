It&#8217;s gotten great reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. It covers some of the basics of how cameras work (f-stops, apertures, ISO&#8217;s), but dives quickly in to topics such as shutter speed, freezing motion, frontlight, the sky brothers, night and low-light photography, aperture and macro photography and more. It&#8217;s about 160 pages long and full color. Although it&#8217;s not 100% digital-friendly (there are a few techniques that only work on film cameras), it&#8217;s a great book with lots of &#8220;correct&#8221; shots side-by-side with a &#8220;creative&#8221; shot of the same scene. Bryan Peterson, the author, explains how there&#8217;s at least 6 correct exposures with every photograph you might take, but they aren&#8217;t all necessarily &#8220;creative&#8221; shots.<\/p>\n<p>The book is intended for a SLR\/DSLR audience, but many of the techniques apply to modern digital cameras as well.
