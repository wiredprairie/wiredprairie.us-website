We spent a lot of time upstairs as her computer and crafting area is on the second floor, as is my den. So, the heat was turned up most of the day.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201clearning\u201d mode of the thermostat decided that as we were home two days in a row, that the whole week likely was going to look like that apparently. As you can see, the same schedule was replicated through all week days. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/image10.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/image_thumb10.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"242\" height=\"128\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>On a normal morning, I often go to my den and do a bit of tinkering before leaving for work. However, I rarely turn up the thermostat and instead just leave it at the preset temperature. I\u2019m not in my den long enough to justify the amount of energy it would take to heat the second floor.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s frustrating that the thermostat would turn up the heat automatically at 9:30am, long after I\u2019ve left for work and then run it all day long. Thankfully, after 3 hours, it apparently realizes there\u2019s no one home, and will automatically adjust the temperature.<\/p>\n<p>Since I didn\u2019t turn the heat UP, I don\u2019t expect to need to turn it DOWN before I leave (I leave earlier than 9:30am). (Turn it down from what?)<\/p>\n<p>I could turn off the learning features. But, then one of the key features of the thermostat is turned off:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/image11.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/image_thumb11.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"242\" height=\"158\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>GregN left a comment yesterday where he mentioned that Nest support recommended to try turning of the learning feature (activating \u201clearning pause\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Now, I need to go fix the schedule to reflect my reality. Again.<\/p>\n<p>Nest, are you listening?
