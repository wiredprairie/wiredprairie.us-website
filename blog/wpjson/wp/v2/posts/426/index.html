Then through a custom engine, they send user events from the client to their special ASP.NET hosted processing engine (ASP.NET plays a very secondary role in their framework &#8212; it&#8217;s really just using it as a way to host .NET code and have access to an HTTP request\/response model). <\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example exchange:<\/p>\n<p>I launched their web application, logged in, and clicked on the second mail entry in the Inbox. <\/p>\n<p>Their Javascript engine sent this to the server:<\/p>\n<p><font face=\"Courier New\" size=\"2\">&lt;ES LR=&#8221;633518368838281250&#8243;&gt;<br \/>&lt;E SR=&#8221;173&#8243; TP=&#8221;SelectionChange&#8221; TRG=&#8221;true&#8221; Indexes=&#8221;1&#8243;\/&gt;<br \/>&lt;E SR=&#8221;173&#8243; TP=&#8221;GotFocus&#8221;\/&gt;&lt;\/ES&gt;<\/font><\/p>\n<p>The server responded with this:<\/p>\n<p>\ufeff<font face=\"Courier New\" size=\"2\">&lt;?xml version=&#8221;1.0&#8243; encoding=&#8221;utf-8&#8243; standalone=&#8221;yes&#8221;?&gt;<br \/>&lt;WG:R LR=&#8221;633518369285000000&#8243; AF=&#8221;202&#8243; FC=&#8221;12&#8243; xmlns:WC=&#8221;wgcontrols&#8221; xmlns:WG=&#8221;<\/font><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gizmox.com\/webgui&quot;\"><font face=\"Courier New\" size=\"2\">http:\/\/www.gizmox.com\/webgui&#8221;<\/font><\/a><font face=\"Courier New\" size=\"2\">&gt;<br \/>&lt;WG:F Id=&#8221;202&#8243;&gt;<br \/>&lt;HDR W=&#8221;186&#8243; H=&#8221;20&#8243; \/&gt;<br \/>&lt;WC:L Id=&#8221;157&#8243; E=&#8221;8&#8243; TI=&#8221;1&#8243; F=&#8221;1&#8243; FN=&#8221;normal normal bold 12pt Tahoma &#8221; TX=&#8221;&#8216;World&#8217;s oldest blogger&#8217; dies at 108Story Highlights&#8221; TA=&#8221;TopLeft&#8221; D=&#8221;F&#8221; \/&gt;<br \/>&lt;WC:L Id=&#8221;155&#8243; E=&#8221;8&#8243; TI=&#8221;2&#8243; F=&#8221;1&#8243; TX=&#8221;7\/14\/2008 10:46:25 PM&#8221; TA=&#8221;TopLeft&#8221; D=&#8221;F&#8221; \/&gt;<br \/>&lt;WC:LV Id=&#8221;163&#8243; E=&#8221;2&#8243; TI=&#8221;1&#8243; F=&#8221;1&#8243; IDD=&#8221;1&#8243; BR=&#8221;none&#8221; D=&#8221;F&#8221; VW=&#8221;SmallIcon&#8221; TX=&#8221;&#8221; CP=&#8221;1&#8243; TOP=&#8221;1&#8243; TOI=&#8221;0&#8243; HDS=&#8221;2&#8243; \/&gt;<br \/>&lt;WC:H Id=&#8221;160&#8243; TI=&#8221;1&#8243; F=&#8221;1&#8243; BR=&#8221;none&#8221; Src=&#8221;Component.172.HtmlBody.wgx&#8221; D=&#8221;F&#8221; \/&gt;<br \/>&lt;\/WG:F&gt;&lt;CMDS \/&gt;&lt;\/WG:R&gt;<\/font><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to pretend to understand all of the nuances of the exchange &#8212; but, it does obviously send the change in selection (implying it has some client knowledge of &#8220;selection&#8221; in a list), and that the same control (guessing &#8220;173&#8221;) also received focus. <\/p>\n<p>The response includes the user interface changes &#8212; the e-mail subject and sent time changed, but the e-mail &#8220;to&#8221; did not change (maybe WC:L is for Label and WC:LV is for ListView?)

They didn&#8217;t. In fact, they&#8217;re hosting the FCKEditor as HTML &#8212; and carefully overlaying the HTML hosting window in exactly the right spot. Tricky &#8212; but it seems to have some oddities with focus that aren&#8217;t entirely explainable. <\/p>\n<p>Even if they did copy their web UI design from the Silverlight.Net home page&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/07\/image15.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"191\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/07\/image-thumb1.png\" width=\"470\" border=\"0\"\/><\/a> <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/07\/image16.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"252\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/07\/image-thumb2.png\" width=\"470\" border=\"0\"\/><\/a> <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still impressed with the technical achievement. That being said, it&#8217;s WAY overpriced at $1,500 &#8211; $1,900 (see license and subscriptions <a href=\"http:\/\/www.visualwebgui.com\/Commercial\/Home\/Products\/tabid\/377\/Default.aspx\">here<\/a>) &#8212; PLUS, <strong>it&#8217;s a subscription (and it&#8217;s licensed per working [sic] station<\/strong>!) Technical support is included, but not hot-fixes, etc. Support is available only 5&#215;9 (not sure what the hours would be since it appears the company is based out of Israel), so you might not want it for a mission critical application (especially since this thing &#8220;is&#8221; your application platform, from start to finish.)<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m familiar with quite a few 3rd party components &#8230; and I&#8217;ve not come across a company that bills for cases that are bugs in their software? (That&#8217;s the way I read their support agreement).<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re considering buying it for a major application, I&#8217;d recommend you be prepared for the company to no longer support the product &#8230; and be sure the license will support you and your needs. Actually, I&#8217;d just recommend your developers learn the actual technology you want to target, be it Ajax, DHTML, Silverlight, etc. and make a great application that way. There&#8217;s a lot of less expensive toolkits, frameworks, etc., to build on, which are less proprietary, better supported, and more efficient.<\/p>\n<p>From their license:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;to install and use the Library in <strong>mechanic<\/strong>-readable object-code&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Uh&#8230; I need to get a mechanic to read the object code? :)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fond of this quote on the page linked above:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Visual WebGui\u2019s \u201cWebmail\u201d is exposed for demo purpose only.
