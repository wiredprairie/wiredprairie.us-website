That\u2019s where Windows has a huge advantage today \u2013 the wide availability of hardware for Windows.

There are frequent updates from Adobe\/Nikon\/Canon\/etc. to handle the constant stream of new file formats and changes that occur from each manufacturer. Maybe they\u2019ve got this all figured out \u2013 but my experience with Linux in the past is that far too often a piece of hardware that worked fine with Windows isn\u2019t recognized by the Linux. <\/p>\n<p>I wonder what Microsoft will do about Silverlight? I\u2019d be disappointed if it didn\u2019t work on this new class of devices if it takes off. But, I also wonder about Flash support. Just because it\u2019s Linux doesn\u2019t mean that Flash will work. Google believes in HTML 5 so much that I can see them not being very \u201copen\u201d about making it work.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you didn\u2019t see the buzz about the Internet in the last 24 hours \u2013 where have you been? :) Google announced officially that they are working on a new operating system, named Google Chrome OS (just rolls off the tongue doesn\u2019t it?).
