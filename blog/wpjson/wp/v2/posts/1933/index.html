The lights wouldn\u2019t show up when the device was tapped and when she used the charger, it wouldn\u2019t begin to charge. I found a few recommendations to use rubber bands to hold the Flex into the charger, cleaning the contacts, and a few more. Cleaning the contacts didn\u2019t help. The charger worked with my Flex, so that meant the rubber band trick wouldn\u2019t help. <\/p>\n<p>I found though on the <a href=\"https:\/\/help.fitbit.com\/customer\/portal\/articles\/1041329\" target=\"_blank\">Fitbit support website<\/a> this morning though a suggestion that worked! Apparently, you can restart\/reset the tracker without loosing data. The steps are easy:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Plug your charging cable into a USB port and insert your Flex as you normally would.<\/li>\n<li>Insert a paperclip into the small pinhole on the back of the charger (<em>I\u2019d never noticed it before, it\u2019s small!<\/em>)<\/li>\n<li>Press gently on the pinhole for 3-4 seconds. You\u2019ll feel a gentle \u2018click\u2019 when you\u2019ve depressed it far enough (although my \u201cone-thousand, two-thousand, three-thousand\u201d count actually got to 6). The lights flashed a few times, and it started charging a few seconds later.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I\u2019m posting this here as my searching the night before hadn\u2019t turned up that specific support web site page. It may be because the web page is poorly titled and applies to four of their trackers.<\/p>\n<p>Hope this helps someone else.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My wife and I both pre-ordered a Fitbit Flex.
