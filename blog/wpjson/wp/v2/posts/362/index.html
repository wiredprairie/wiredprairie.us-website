The discussion was about how they don&#8217;t use Photoshop as part of the design process. I can see it working well for them. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" height=\"193\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/06\/image15.png\" width=\"288\" border=\"0\"\/> <\/p>\n<p>Their user interfaces are plain and simple. Not hard to mock up quickly using any basic editors. <\/p>\n<p>Robby <a href=\"http:\/\/notstatic.com\/archives\/120\">suggested<\/a> that it&#8217;s the opposite of his experience (generally). By using Photoshop (or similar)&#8230; <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also end up pushing things further (visually or even at the interaction level) because the tool gets me there quicker.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I totally agree &#8212; if 37signals had richer designs and user interface requirements, I bet they&#8217;d finding themselves using some other tools to create their user interfaces. (and they recently had a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.37signals.com\/svn\/posts\/1076-were-looking-for-a-designer-who-wants-to-kick-our-ass-and-change-our-game\">job posting<\/a> advertising the need for a killer designer with virtual free reign &#8230; I bet they don&#8217;t stick to a syntax highlight text editor &#8230;. :) ).<\/p>\n<p>Personally, I use a wide mix of tools &#8212; whatever seems right and wouldn&#8217;t want to set artificial boundaries.<\/p>\n<p>I try to start out with some sketches on paper or a whiteboard. <\/p>\n<p>The next step depends a lot on the scale and challenges of the specific project. If I really want to concentrate on the user interface and the overall experience, I&#8217;ll use a tool like Photoshop or Illustrator. It allows me to make quick changes to the user interface without a lot of fuss (and create lots of different versions). If I have a bit more time, and a prototype implementation would be reasonable, I&#8217;ll often break out a development tool and mock it up and experiment. For less important projects, I&#8217;ll proceed directly to end game and work on the final user interface directly in the actual project (if I&#8217;m able to do that). <\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s definitely no right answer for everyone. It makes sense to use the right tool for the job. However, I&#8217;m sure some of my readers work with companies or on jobs where there are rules in place regarding the tools, steps, etc. If you&#8217;d care to summarize and share, I&#8217;d love to hear them! <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re creating an application with a user interface, what tools do you use &#8212; and when do you use them?
