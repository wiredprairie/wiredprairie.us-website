I\u2019ve bought a few battery chargers over the years with a few features, but I always have been disappointed when batteries fail to charge fully. In the past, I\u2019ve resorted to recycling them. <\/p>\n<p>No more! This thing has brought back batteries that would only take a partial charge in other chargers! <strong>Awesome<\/strong>! I had a few recently purchased <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000LNI5VC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000LNI5VC\">Sanyo Eneloop batteries<\/a> that would not fully charge (80% charge). Worse, and to add to the insult, the new mini Apple battery charger refused to charge them!<\/p>\n<p>After using the charger\u2019s Discharge\/Refresh cycle on the batteries, the batteries not only take a full charge now, but they also work in the Apple battery charger as well!Slick! It took a few days for the batteries to complete the cycle, but it was definitely worth the wait. I restored some seriously old rechargeable batteries that wouldn\u2019t take a charge that was more than 20-30% of the full charge anymore. They now too take a full charge (I had to run one battery through two long discharge\/refresh cycles).<\/p>\n<p>Also nice about this charger is that each battery can be separately charged \/ refreshed using different settings. No worries about always finding a second battery to charge. <\/p>\n<p>Apparently, there are some geek settings as part of the device, but I\u2019m not a battery nut. I just want it to work, so I haven\u2019t really paid much attention. You can get a lot more geekery by reading through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B000RSOV50?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000RSOV50\">comments<\/a> at Amazon. Based on my initial search, I discovered that there were some issues surrounding overheating of a few different battery charger models from more than one manufacturer. So, I put the battery charger on a cheap IKEA plate I recently purchased to prevent any damage that might occur if the charger exceeded expected operating temperatures. I\u2019ve not noticed that the charger has been any warmer than room temperature, even after one of the long recharge cycles. I\u2019ve only used the lower voltage charging option though, as I wasn\u2019t in a rush. <\/p>\n<p>You have to press a few buttons to get a non-default charge operation going \u2013 but it\u2019s really easy to do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stupidly highly recommended<\/strong>. It\u2019s around $26 US at Amazon right now. If you use more than a few AA (or AAA) rechargeable batteries, you need this. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t buy it years ago when it first came out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve never been excited about a battery charger before.
