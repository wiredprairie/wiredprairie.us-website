Its ports are bound to 127.0.0.1 rather than 0.0.0.0, thus preventing it from being usable from other machines. I wanted to install this on an always-on PC in our house rather than install it on my home workstation. I can sort of see why they want to limit it, but come-on, this is for development purposes. It&#8217;s\u00a0not set up for availability, performance, etc. One simple right click of the app-tray icon resets and clears all the data. There are a number of effective ways for making it developer only &#8212; and I wouldn&#8217;t have picked this one.<\/li>\n<li>It has constantly used CPU, even when it&#8217;s not being used. On my laptop for example, it was hovering around 10-15% CPU, even when there were zero active connections. This problem isn&#8217;t consistent as I installed it on a secondary workstation and it&#8217;s using a lot of RAM (nearly 400MB), but only 1% CPU.<\/li>\n<li>It&#8217;s Windows only. This is actually a minor point if you&#8217;re using Windows, but if you want to use a Mac and do development, even\u00a0with a VM hosted emulator, you won&#8217;t be able to.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So, for the best experience with DocumentDB, you&#8217;ll likely need to stick with the pay-to-play option of hosting it in Azure.
