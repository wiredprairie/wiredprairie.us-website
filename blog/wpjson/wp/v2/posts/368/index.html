But if the web requires Flash or Silverlight to run, Adobe or Microsoft can either intentionally kill alternative platforms like the Mac (or Linux), or simply make them work so poorly due to their own incompetence that those platforms risk becoming non-viable. Adobe has already proven its incompetence in delivering Flash for the Mac (and really any platform outside of Windows), and I shouldn\u2019t need to recap Microsoft\u2019s historical readiness to destroy anything that isn\u2019t Windows.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Right, sure. Overall the article\/post was reasonably well thought through, but the paragraph above should have been a little more grounded in reality. Microsoft has written a great Office application for the Mac that have gotten very good reviews over the years. Adobe&#8217;s tools power the Mac design-types desktops (and without Adobe and Microsoft, Apple would have had slim chance of surviving years ago). So, Adobe may have created a few shoddy builds of Flash &#8230;. Nobody is perfect. Show me some proof that it was intentional on Adobe&#8217;s part. <\/p>\n<p>Regarding Cocoa &#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That has not only allowed Apple to advance its own rich web apps using open web standards, but also to share SproutCore, its Cocoa-inspired, cross platform JavaScript frameworks, under an open source MIT license. That sharing will help provide an open alternative to Flash in the RIA space. SproutCore doesn\u2019t compete against the use of Flash to make animated ads or navigation applets, but rather in deploying full, highly interactive applications, the target of Adobe\u2019s Flash-based AIR platform plans. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Seriously? No wonder we need faster computers, more memory &#8230; because &#8220;we&#8217;re&#8221; trying to push a platform designed for basic interactivity into a full application development platform. <\/p>\n<p>But, I digress. I don&#8217;t want applications to be hampered by HTML limitations. The industry can slowly continue to extend the browser by adding capabilities and functionality &#8212; and it still won&#8217;t be a &#8220;future platform.&#8221; It&#8217;s like we all took a GIANT step backward in terms of computers and interactivity in some senses (look at the power in Vista and OSX from a sheer platform capability &#8212; yet it <strong>ALL GOES WASTED <\/strong>on the browser). Some nice stuff can be made of course, and that&#8217;s all great &#8212; but it&#8217;s still HTML, regardless of whether it&#8217;s hosted live or offline, inside an Internet connected browser or saved locally. <\/p>\n<p>Users &#8212; <strong>they don&#8217;t care<\/strong>. Before you complain, I&#8217;m certain a lot of my readers are passionate about their favorite browser, but the vast majority of users don&#8217;t care. The more web applications that come out and work on <strong>any modern web browser<\/strong>, the better (for all of us). As the number of web applications increases, and the quality is &#8220;good enough&#8221; &#8230; the platform becomes less significant &#8212; even stagnant. What will drive future operating system purchases? Even Apple will stagnate &#8211; if the operating system doesn&#8217;t matter to end users.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where I&#8217;d like to think that these browser plug-ins, be they Silverlight or Flash, or <em>The Next Big Thing<\/em> come into play. They can harness more of the host operating system &#8212; creating some truly exciting applications. But, unfortunately, they still leave much of the operating system untapped, even as browser plug-ins. If Windows 7 ships with Multi-touch support built in, there isn&#8217;t going to be a single application or plug-in that will be able to take advantage of it without additional development. But, it&#8217;s less likely to happen if all platforms (Mac and Windows) don&#8217;t support the functionality. It&#8217;s still uncertain that a browser plug-in would drive future operating system purchases. <\/p>\n<p>Can they make revenue from selling\/renting applications? Honestly, that&#8217;s a tough business as too many free options will likely continue to exist. Apple for one could create a branded experience in iTunes for purchasing a web application license, but people are cheap (I&#8217;m no different, if there&#8217;s a free option that is decent, I&#8217;ll go with that). Apple could provide developers with a web development platform (thinking like Google web application development platform), but again, there&#8217;s that little challenge of revenue. All of this may only amount to pocket change when compared to today&#8217;s revenues for big companies. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll take a longer look at SproutCore, but all of the stuff I saw was about how it interacted with Ruby on Rails &#8212; so I don&#8217;t know how intertwined they all are (and I don&#8217;t have the patience to do Ruby right now).<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s your take? Is it important that your Javascript framework mirror a client framework (like Objective-C and Cocoa)? Or is it just a gimmick (and developers should concentrate on innovation rather than imitation)? <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From the web site, RoughlyDrafted magazine, Cocoa for Windows + Flash Killer = SproutCore.
