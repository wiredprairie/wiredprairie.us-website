I personally think the list is too slanted on &#8220;Agile&#8221; practices. What works for a web application software provider may not work well for an ISV or an enterprise developer in all cases.<\/p>\n<p>I would have expected some mention of one of the classic books of software development to be mentioned, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0735619670?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0735619670\">Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction<\/a><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"margin: 0px; border-top-style: none! important; border-right-style: none! important; border-left-style: none! important; border-bottom-style: none! important\" src=\"http:\/\/www.assoc-amazon.com\/e\/ir?t=wiredp-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0735619670\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" \/> by Steve McConnell.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe the biggest issue I have with the list is that even if I checked all of these off while interviewing someone, I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d hire them. There are a few things I&#8217;d add for a developer to be a rock star. The following are a few ideas.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Certainly, I look for &#8220;passion&#8221; or &#8220;energy&#8221; when interviewing. You can love to code &#8211; but will you love coding what I need you to code? Will you believe in the project or application? Will it excite you?<\/li>\n<li>Do you work well on a team? Individuality is important, but being a great peer is an important trait to have. Maybe the best way I could think about this is: even rock stars need a band (or at least a supporting crew). Having a good team behind the &#8220;rockstar&#8221; is just as important as having the rockstar &#8230; actually, maybe more important! So, don&#8217;t leave the band out of the rock star.<\/li>\n<li>Do you understand the platform you&#8217;ll be working on? How well can you learn it? It&#8217;s not about a programming language or knowing basic computer science &#8230; if you don&#8217;t know how the system works (ticks), are you going to be as effective as the engineer who does (I doubt it).<\/li>\n<li>Can you communicate well &#8212; in whatever form is necessary? It&#8217;s not about the language so much as your ability to communicate ideas, problems, solutions, etc. well to others. I&#8217;m not suggesting you need to do a presentation to a Board of Directors or 500 people at the next conference &#8230; just to your coworkers, one on one, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What would you add?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From ReadWriteWeb, &#8220;Top 10 Traits of a Rockstar Software Engineer.&#8221; See the full post for the details of each point.
