For former Apple employees, it&#8217;s providing an Objective C like layer for Javascript (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wait-till-i.com\/2008\/06\/05\/north280-bring-keynote-to-the-web\/\">source here<\/a>). The abstraction layer is useful &#8212; but at what cost for a new language layer on top of Javascript?

Lots of square brackets. When the browser gets served .j files, it preprocesses them on the fly. This means that you can do things like, use standard JavaScript in places. <\/p>\n<p>Cappuccino is the port of the Cocoa framework.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The market is becoming saturated with these products.
