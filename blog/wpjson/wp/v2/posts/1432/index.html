I had time this afternoon to do a swap and reinstall. Nest had asked me to swap the thermostats between two floors experimentally to determine whether a temperature reading issue was related to the location or the thermostat. It was the thermostat. <\/p>\n<p>As part of the swap, I had to reprogram the two thermostats.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d swapped the defective thermostat with one from the basement. Apparently, the base has the S\/N on it of the thermostat and they\u2019re intended to be \u201cpaired\u201d so I decided to return the thermostat to the basement and install the new thermostat on the first floor (replacing the original defective unit).<\/p>\n<p>I removed the old unit and replaced the wires. Depending on the type of wires you\u2019re using, you may find that it\u2019s far more difficult to do than you would expect. I \u2018d forgotten how much I hated trying to stick the very stiff HVAC wires into the thermostat\u2019s base! <\/p>\n<p>I replaced everything and activated the unit. You can look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/index.php\/archives\/1329\">installation experience post<\/a> for more information about the general setup. <\/p>\n<p>Past the wifi connection, rebooting, waiting, waiting, waiting, then \u201cERROR.\u201d \u201cNo Rc or Rh\u201d connection.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"20111218-IMG_0138\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/20111218-IMG_0138_thumb.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Crud<\/strong>. So, I popped the thermostat off the base and looked at the wires. They all appeared to be fine. So, I reseated the Rc connection and replaced the thermostat. Success! I find that a tiny tug on the wire after you believe it has been seated does the trick. The rest of the <em>install<\/em> went without issue. <\/p>\n<p>The thermostat switched to the normal temperature display after a few more alerts. The only thing was \u2013 the temperature read 76F. Whaaaa? Given the reboot cycles, etc., I really hadn\u2019t handled it much, not enough to cause the temperature to be that high. I waited about 5 minutes for it to start dropping and when it did not, I called Nest to speak with the person who\u2019d handled the replacement, Mark. He was out apparently, so I ended up speaking with someone who went by \u201cDK\u201d for about 30 minutes about a few topics. <\/p>\n<p>We decided the best course of action was to wait and see. <\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, the new thermostat is now reading a temperature that I would expect, so for some reason, this new thermostat took quite a while to acclimate to the room temperature (much longer than the original three thermostats \u2013 around 45 minutes).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Update #6, Update #5, Update #4, Update #3, Update #2, Update #1, Install I received a replacement thermostat earlier this week as promised by Nest Labs.
