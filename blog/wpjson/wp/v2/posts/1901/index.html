I installed it on a shared, always-on Windows 8 Pro PC that does a ton of other things for our house like security camera monitoring, file shares, etc. It installed easily and was up and running quickly. While the paid version is far outside of my budget for this type of thing (budget=$0), the freeware version had just the right features for me.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s got tons of things it can monitor, but with the freeware limit of 10 devices, I\u2019ve got it monitoring traffic, disk and a few other things:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/image3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/image_thumb3.png\" width=\"602\" height=\"213\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve got the default page set to just show the internet bandwidth (in\/out):<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/image4.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/image_thumb4.png\" width=\"602\" height=\"354\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The software automatically scanned my network and found way more things to monitor originally than I had expected. <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a reasonably sophisticated Ajax web application that works well on modern browsers.
