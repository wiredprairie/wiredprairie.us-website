Honestly, I expected they\u2019d ship just the display and the base (as the support engineer hadn\u2019t set any expectations, I apparently just made up my own!). But, I suppose at this point in the company, they just aren\u2019t setup to ship just the two pieces. It has the unfortunate side effect of producing extra waste (as I can\u2019t imagine that extra wall plates are going to come in handy anywhere). The little screw driver could be given away but the rest likely will end up in a landfill. I\u2019ll ship them all of the unused parts back as I don\u2019t want them \u2013 hopefully they don\u2019t just trash them.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019ve been some really <strong>awesome commenters <\/strong>in the past few days and I wanted to take a moment to highlight a few key comments.<\/p>\n<p>From Curt:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I finally called Nest and spoke to a pleasant fellow. First off, it turns out the Nest does NOT anticipate a temperature set point. It will not turn on the furnace ahead of time. If you train it to go from the night setting of 60 to the daytime setting of 68 by turning it to 68 when you get up, it will always be 60 when you get up.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Wow, that\u2019s a super disappointment. Honestly, I really thought it could do that.<\/p>\n<p>Another from Curt:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It does not keep as steady a temperature as the primitive Honeywell round thermostat it replaced.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>From Mark:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve had my Nest for about 10 days. I would recommend waiting before buying one.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Kevin:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve been considering replacing my Honeywell programmable t\u2019stat with a Nest\u2026but now I\u2019m not so sure<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>David shares my disappointment regarding Nest Labs:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would love to hear what NEST has to say about the variances\u2026I would think they are monitoring these blogs\u2026..If they are not\u2026shame on them.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>They seem to be way too quiet. They don\u2019t seem to \u201cget\u201d social media.<\/p>\n<p>And Matt provided a link to a very complete tear-down of the device:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here is a good site that did a tear-down,lots of comments and people look like they really know what there talking about!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sparkfun.com\/tutorials\/334\">http:\/\/www.sparkfun.com\/tutorials\/334<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>GregN is still enthused about his Nest thermostat:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You guys are right in all the above posts. But to be honest, I\u2019m happy with setting a schedule that warms the house before I get up in the morning, and saves energy overnight. Yes, I had that functionality at a lower price point before the Nest. But I didn\u2019t have remote adjustments or the great looking hockey puck on my wall before.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Thanks again for all the comments!
