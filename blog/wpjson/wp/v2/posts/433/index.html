Plain and simple. There&#8217;s edge cases sure&#8211;but they don&#8217;t count (sorry). Apple has an edge right now because of a false perception of Vista in the marketplace, one that Apple successfully groomed and grew through a series of very successful (and very misleading) advertisements (the Mac and Windows guy ads). Apple has YEARS of experience with user experience. So does Microsoft (I&#8217;ll point out that one of Microsoft&#8217;s biggests problem with user experience is the desire to not make a large group of users unhappy by changing the operating system dramatically &#8212; it&#8217;s not by any means due to lack of designer talent). Comparitively, the Linux camp really has zero years of experience competitively.<\/p>\n<p>Can the Ubuntu crowd innovate and not copy? Linux GUI&#8217;s have historically cloned, not innovated.  <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"301\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/07\/image18.png\" width=\"470\" border=\"0\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>Ubuntu seems to be a mix of OSX and Windows.&nbsp; Take a look at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kde.org\">KDE<\/a> though (the shell of choice for many Linux distributions). <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"358\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/07\/image19.png\" width=\"470\" border=\"0\"\/>  <\/p>\n<p>Wow! Look, on the left is the &#8220;start button&#8221;, followed by the &#8220;Start&#8221; menu from Windows 2000 (or maybe a little earlier).&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see, big ugly quick start buttons. A Calendar that looks more like a toy than a professional widget, 2 rows of tasks in the &#8220;task bar&#8221;, and a series of tray icons for some things that must be running that are always available. For haters of Windows, they certainly copied the user experience adequately. <\/p>\n<p>If Ubuntu creates something that is &#8220;art&#8221; &#8230; will it be so different that few will adopt it? <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m interested to see what happens &#8230; will they be able to innovate on the Linux platform or will legacy applications and requirements (the platform) hold them back? Even eye candy won&#8217;t make Linux easier. If they can take the &#8220;unix&#8221; out of Linux &#8230; then, maybe they&#8217;ll have something (or do what Apple did, and take just the good of a platform and shield users away from it at <strong>all costs<\/strong>, except allow nerds access). <\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s going to take more than a few years and a desire to make this happen. Even having funding won&#8217;t necessary make it happen. Look and Lindows, I mean Linspire, I mean Xandros Linspire. They had staff, funding, and a desire to put Linux on every desktop. Bzzzzzt. Didn&#8217;t happen. What&#8217;s changed? <\/p>\n<p>Are you interested if something came out from Ubuntu? How revolutionary would it need to be for you to adopt? Or have web applications made platform matter less?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As reported by The Register, Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Ubuntu Linux said that the company is working to make the Ubuntu desktop &#8220;more beautiful&#8221; in the next two years &#8212; to something that&#8217;s art. &#8220;I think the great task in front of us in the next two years is to lift the experience of the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true},"categories":[8,3],"tags":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pd5QIe-6Z","jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[{"id":175,"url":"https:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/index.php\/archives\/175","url_meta":{"origin":433,"position":0},"title":"What&#8217;s the perfect API?","date":"May 5, 2008","format":false,"excerpt":"I was skimming a rant by someone on arstechnica about how badly messed up Win32 APIs are and how superior everything else is, when this paragraph grabbed my attention: The reason must be that no one in Microsoft actually gives a damn.
