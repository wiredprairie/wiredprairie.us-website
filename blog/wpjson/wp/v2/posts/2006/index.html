This may be important to you as it was to me.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>While the instructions for the aero bar are unnecessarily and unfortunately terse, they\u2019re relatively easy to install. <\/p>\n<p>Once I installed the aero bars per the instructions I couldn\u2019t initially find a satisfactory location for my GoPro. I like riding with the GoPro set to 1 second time-lapse \u2026 then put to video (the results are often mesmerizing!). <\/p>\n<p>A few months ago, I purchased a non-GoPro Hero mount for my bicycle, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B005YVTKT2\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005YVTKT2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkId=SMUDTVIT7RPXNTLY\" target=\"_blank\">K-EDGE GO BIG Pro HandleBar Mount<\/a>. I bought this to reduce the vibrations and also better secure the Hero to the bicycle. Before the K-EDGE, I simply could not get the mount to stay consistently secure on my semi-bumpy rides. It would slowly change positions and ruin a large segment of the captures if I didn\u2019t notice it quickly. The K-EDGE is certainly a premium product (but made in the USA!). <\/p>\n<p>The K-EDGE is <strong>ROCK SOLID<\/strong>. I couldn\u2019t believe how much better the results were when the camera would stay firmly in position. While it can\u2019t solve the problem of a bumpy ride, the camera shakes less on it\u2019s own (reducing secondary vibrations). <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1163\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_1163\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/IMG_1163.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With the K-EDGE, the mount takes up very little space on the handlebars, unlike the original GoPro bicycle mount. So, by orienting the K-EDGE down and flipping the Hero, the image nicely captures the scene in front of the bicycle without being obscured by the aero bars.<\/p>\n<p>I also own the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00BN7XNQW\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BN7XNQW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkId=NV3F6B3EIYUQYY2B\">Annex Quad Lock Bike Mount Kit for iPhone 5\/5S \u2013 Black<\/a>. At first I was concerned that the combination of the aero bars, and the phone would be a disaster (and that there wouldn\u2019t be enough room to properly snap and lock the quad lock case onto the bicycle mount). In fact, there isn\u2019t room. But, in about 5 seconds, you can release the tension on one of the aero bars, flip the small catch, and remove the bar completely. Snap the phone onto the Quad Lock, and replace the bar. It\u2019s a really nice setup.<img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1160\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_1160\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/IMG_1160.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What didn\u2019t work out was the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00IHPIH1E\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00IHPIH1E&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkId=IRVMHCJEUAYZX6KT\">Redshift Computer Mount for Quick-Release Aerobars<\/a>. I didn\u2019t realize that the mount was not the same diameter as my road bike handle bars. In fact, it\u2019s small enough that I don\u2019t have a single thing that would attach to it. I had a wonderful steel bicycle bell I\u2019d bought via a Kickstarter that unfortunately doesn\u2019t have a home on my bike anymore. I thought it would attach to the computer mount, but it\u2019s much too large as is. I\u2019ll probably need to rig up some extra padding for it to make up the difference, but I\u2019d hate to loose the bell to my faulty contraption. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1158\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_1158\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/IMG_1158.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From the back \u2026<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG_1162\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_1162\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/IMG_1162.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" \/><\/p>\n<p>On my first ride with the aero bars I noticed they\u2019d rattle a tiny bit when riding. After stopping and over-analyzing the situation, I noticed that I simply had not tightened the quick release bolt well enough. An extra turn on both made them both rattle-free.<\/p>\n<p>I also didn\u2019t care for the raw feel of the bars, so I added handle-bar tape to the end where I rest my hands.
