Why would it EVER dump that information? It\u2019s literally its key to being a smart thermostat.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, as we still have 2 other thermostats in the house, it was simple to add the account back to the thermostat after entering the wifi password again, as the thermostat recognized that there were other Nests nearby.<\/p>\n<p>Without the wifi connection, you still have a thermostat (thankfully!). However, you loose all remote scheduling capabilities via their web site or apps.<\/p>\n<p>I still can\u2019t recommend these thermostats.
