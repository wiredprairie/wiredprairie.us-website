It is difficult for host providers to support allowing each user the ability to run their own JVM processes in a sustained fashion. I remember the days when using PostgresSQL required you to have a dedicated server whereas you could use mysql easily by just setting up yourself for a small multi-tenant plan on a web server out there. Today Java is like PostgreSQL of those days. There is no easy way to simply set yourself up to run a small Java application in a shared tenant environment. Even if you did set yourself up chances are that you would be far less than satisfied with the performance in a multi tenant situation even though Java is actually a really really fast language.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>When I had a passing fancy recently regarding Java recently &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t find a hosting provider for any price I was comfortable paying. The problem is summed up nicely above &#8212; it&#8217;s too hard to host. Java on the web &#8212; mainstream web &#8212; is never going to catch on if it can&#8217;t overcome at least this hurdle. <\/p>\n<p>The only web platforms that are going to survive the long haul must adapt to the new web development model of shared hosting and inexpensive hosting, easy scaling &#8230;, simple and convenient programming; all things that the traditional Java web platforms does poorly. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An interesting blog post discussing the merits of trying to simplify the Java web server runtime.
