There isn\u2019t any publically available information about what was updated however other than \u201cbug fixes.\u201d Thanks to <strong>GregN<\/strong> for pointing it out. Here\u2019s a link to their current software releases and updates for anyone interested:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/support.nest.com\/customer\/portal\/articles\/246009-nest-learning-thermostat-nest-mobile-software-updates\">http:\/\/support.nest.com\/customer\/portal\/articles\/246009-nest-learning-thermostat-nest-mobile-software-updates<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This week, one of my thermostats in \u201clearning\u201d mode wiped out some of the set points I had specifically added for the weekend (this has happened before). I have no rational explanation for why it would do this as our weekend schedule on the floor where it happened is routine enough that it shouldn\u2019t have made that choice. Nest Labs support suggests turning off \u201clearning\u201d mode when this has occurred to see if it\u2019s related to learning mode. They apparently don\u2019t have a way to track the causes or triggers unfortunately (a debug log would come in very handy now). I turned it off for the time being and have added the deleted set points to see if the problem occurs again.<\/p>\n<p><font style=\"background-color: #ffff00\">UPDATE: 1\/25\/2012:<\/font>&#160; One of our thermostats that still has \u201clearning\u201d turned off decided that our morning set points for our first floor weren\u2019t important and deleted them. Apparently, we didn\u2019t want the house to start warming before we got out of bed. <\/p>\n<p>I found an interesting issue with the Away Temperature settings that you\u2019ll want to watch out for until they fix it (as it could affect triggers for \u201cauto away\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, there are values that when you put them into the away temperature field, they won\u2019t \u201cstick.\u201d You won\u2019t necessarily notice this right away unless you click around:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/nestrounding.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"display: inline\" title=\"nestrounding\" alt=\"nestrounding\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/nestrounding_thumb.gif\" width=\"508\" height=\"348\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the video (GIF) above, you\u2019ll see how the \u201c58\u201d won\u2019t stay 58F. It switches to 57 (it happens with 60F as well). I\u2019ve sent a support request to Nest about the issue (they responded the following day and said they\u2019d look into it). Since their web API deals with Celsius, I speculate it could be a rounding issue in their JavaScript code.<\/p>\n<p><font style=\"background-color: #ffff00\">Update: 1\/24\/2012<\/font> The bug appears appears to have been corrected in the few places I happened to check earlier today (as I\u2019m not their QA team, I didn\u2019t check around much <img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile\" alt=\"Smile\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/wlEmoticon-smile7.png\" \/>).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Randal<\/strong> pointed out that there was someone who\u2019d done some <a href=\"http:\/\/davidwallen.net\/2012\/01\/nest-learning-thermostat-initial-data\/\">analysis<\/a> of the temperature readings of a working Nest thermostat (compared to another thermostat). I\u2019d concur that the readings do seem to be far more consistently accurate on the Nest thermostat on average and that our house is more comfortable. However, I\u2019m certainly aware that this comfort will come at a cost. The house is more consistently warmer (now in the heating season). So, depending on your old thermostats and how you handled the temperature in the house, you may find your heating costs rise a bit. Simple way to compensate: you may be able to turn down the thermostat a few degrees! <img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile\" alt=\"Smile\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/wlEmoticon-smile4.png\" \/> The temperature may read lower, but the actual temperature may be closer to what you had grown accustomed to. We may do that.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m still trying to understand why \u201cAuto Away\u201d is sometimes triggered when I wouldn\u2019t expect it. I believe that once it was because the \u201caway\u201d temperatures were one degree LESS than the typical set point. So, the house would not \u201csee us\u201d around, and compared the day time (at work for example) set point (60F) to the \u201caway\u201d temperature (59F) and activate the \u201caway\u201d mode. I found the issue with the away temperature above when I was trying to make everything match one evening this week.&#160; The problem with Auto-away activating is that your scheduled set points won\u2019t be used until it is overridden via the remote interface or locally.<\/p>\n<p><font style=\"background-color: #ffff00\">Update: 1\/25\/2012<\/font>: Apparently, auto-away unfortunately can trigger even when the temperature settings match exactly. (Even when there\u2019s nothing to do). I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s \u201cauto-awaying\u201d from. <\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a few relevant tweets from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/nest\">@Nest<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/image27.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/image_thumb17.png\" width=\"515\" height=\"366\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Although I admit to not understanding the topmost tweet.
