This latest post walks through the general clean up of the title bar, menu bars, address bar, and bookmark bar in Firefox.<\/p>\n<p>I must say that the new proposals for Firefox finally take the UI from a all-too typical layout to something modern, hip, and <strong>clean<\/strong>. A web browser should not interfere with the one task it is intended to perform: view and interact with web pages. <\/p>\n<p>For normal browsing (and not development) I use Google\u2019s Chrome browser nearly exclusively, and when I don\u2019t use it, I switch to IE 8. That combo works well enough (and best handles sites that are more IE friendly than they are web-standards friendly).<\/p>\n<p>I particularly like Chrome\u2019s clean approach to full screen web browsing. Admittedly, having more than a couple dozen tabs open tends to make the tabs a bit unwieldy (I\u2019ve got 44 tabs open in Chrome right now).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/12\/image2.png\" width=\"371\" height=\"258\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>Compared to Firefox (one of the proposals and the current 3.5 shipping UI), the proposals definitely modernize the user experience of Firefox, yet not quite maximizing the web application experience like Chrome does so well (<em>Firefox images grabbed from Stephen\u2019s web site<\/em>):<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Firefox 4 and Firefox 3.5 Visual Comparison\" src=\"http:\/\/www.stephenhorlander.com\/images\/blog-posts\/windows-theme-i03-app-button\/3.5-4.0-Comparison.png\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure that the orange Firefox button is really necessary though for the average user (at the cost of a significant amount of horizontal and vertical pixel-estate). What kind of actions would users expect to find there? But more importantly, what would the UI for the drop down look like? <\/p>\n<p>It would be a big failure if it was nothing more than a cascading drop down menu, for example, like I\u2019ve configured in Firefox 3.5 with some extension who\u2019s name I\u2019ve forgotten.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/12\/image3.png\" width=\"267\" height=\"296\" \/> <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/12\/image4.png\" width=\"289\" height=\"296\" \/> <\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p>Overall, I do consider this progress though, and appreciate the transparency of the design process with the next version of Firefox. <\/p>\n<p>And I, unlike some of the commenters on Stephen\u2019s blog, feel like it\u2019s more important to make progress rather than be artificially held back by old designs, and not giving into lots of options and configuration choices which cater to vocal groups (so that they can never change). In this case, I\u2019d follow Apple and Google\u2019s lead (and even Microsoft\u2019s to some extent when it comes to applications):&#160; make it good, make it simple, don\u2019t put it lots of bells and whistles and don\u2019t make it too configurable.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve enjoyed following the thought pattern of Stephen regarding the major iteration of the Firefox user interface and experience here.
