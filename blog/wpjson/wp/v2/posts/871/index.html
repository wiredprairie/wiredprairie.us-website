Seriously. JavaScript, born in <strong>1995<\/strong>. It\u2019s 14 freaking years old as of this December (as it was first released in December 1995). We\u2019ve got budding programmers who were born AFTER it was created. JavaScript, unlike many of it\u2019s commonly used, similarly aged counterparts, has not had any significant upgrades or improvements to reflect new market needs. Java and C++ both have (Java got generics for example), and C# was born in the last decade. I like Silverlight more than Flash only because of the programming language (and IDE) attached with its development.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s my short list of complaints about JavaScript:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic typing \u2013 great, I can\u2019t know until runtime what a type should be, and even then it could change. Makes for a great time. <\/li>\n<li>Prototype \u2013 oh don\u2019t get me started on the patterns that are necessary to create a robust object oriented framework in JavaScript \u2013 and \u201cthis\u201d, and \u201coops, you\u2019re missing a comma, good luck finding that!\u201d <\/li>\n<li>Closures \u2013 the source of too many memory leaks and confusion over the years, especially given the subtly of its behavior in JavaScript <\/li>\n<li>No official \u201cimports\u201d or \u201cusings\u201d to make doing code-completion practical, and one JavaScript file can\u2019t declare another JavaScript file as a dependency and have it automatically be loaded (just once of course), without creating a new framework. <\/li>\n<li>Run-time code discovery \u2013 it\u2019s great to be able to load things dynamically, but it\u2019s completely a mess at design time trying to sort everything out and make sense of a large application. <\/li>\n<li>Debugging \u2013 terrible IDE and debugging support across the browsers. Too many \u201calert\u201d style debugging workflows in this day and age. <\/li>\n<li>Interpreted \u2013 still making the browser do extra work and a bonus feature: you don\u2019t know about coding errors until you try to execute the code! <\/li>\n<li>Poor internationalization support \u2013 to do it right, you need to build functions or get a library to parse and format properly <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(Don\u2019t get me started about the inconsistency of DOM access from JavaScript across browsers \u2013 which I realize isn\u2019t JavaScript \u2013 it\u2019s a browser thing \u2013 but they\u2019re intertwined from all practical purposes).<\/p>\n<p>(And, I\u2019m not complaining about a web application that consists of 2 JavaScript files, where one of them is JQuery. Think big. Applications. Complex workflows. Frameworks. Etc. It\u2019s tough stuff. It\u2019s doable, but unnecessarily difficult).<\/p>\n<p>Major Web applications would have taken off long ago if the entire development experience\/environment would have modeled after something like Visual Basic 3, 4, 5,&#160; or 6. Web applications are still held back by an awful development experience.<\/p>\n<p>Do you love JavaScript?
