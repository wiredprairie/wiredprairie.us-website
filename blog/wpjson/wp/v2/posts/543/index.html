This technique doesn&#8217;t allow the designer to have freedom to decide how to build the interface freely. If you wire up to a &#8220;button&#8221; click, then the designer has to implement a certain UI feature as a button. Maybe that&#8217;s not what they wanted. The UI\/code are wound together extremely tightly when using this pattern. <\/p>\n<p>A command\/message driven architecture that splits the actual implementation as much as possible is the best pattern for growth and true separation of roles. That being said, it&#8217;s not always practical to build a system like that. <\/p>\n<p>I like the CONCEPT of WPF&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.windows.input.routedcommand.aspx\">RoutedCommand<\/a> system which is a way in WPF to handle this pattern, but I don&#8217;t care for the way that things are enabled and disabled via the <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/system.windows.input.commandbinding.canexecute.aspx\">CanExecute<\/a> event handlers. The event handlers can be called hundreds of times a minute depending on your user interface. <\/p>\n<p>The bad news is that Silverlight doesn&#8217;t lend itself easily to a message\/command driven architecture (as the RoutedCommand system isn&#8217;t available in Silverlight 2.0). So what&#8217;s a developer to do? :)<\/p>\n<p>I like the &#8216;toolability&#8217; of doing inline (in XAML) wire-up of events. If the developer just provides a common set of end-points (events) to the UI designer, then they may have an opportunity to more freely control and adjust the user interface as needed without requiring code changes. <\/p>\n<p>So in John&#8217;s example code, instead of <\/p>\n<p>btnAddToCard.Click += new RoutedEventHandler(btnAddToCard_Click);<\/p>\n<p>It might be better to provide a method called:<\/p>\n<p>AddToCard(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {<\/p>\n<p>}<\/p>\n<p>That way, the designer can wire-up any way they want. <\/p>\n<p>Or, I suppose one could build a rudimentary message\/command system by using <a href=\"http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/library\/cc265152(VS.95).aspx\">attached properties<\/a> and a common event handler which handles all command driven user interface elements. (And now that I think about that more &#8212; I think that could end up being quite slick if done carefully). <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From JohnPapa.net, &#8220;Siliverlight 2-Tip &#8211; Declaring Events.&#8221; He thinks that the place to wire up an event is always in code rather than in markup (like XAML). &#8220;What\u2019s my opinion?
