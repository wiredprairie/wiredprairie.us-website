However, while my MacBook Pro had discharged like this before, it would normally start charging right away.<\/p>\n<p>So, apparently, before taking it in for a repair (which is what a lot of people in forums were recommending), you might try resetting the <a href=\"http:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US\">System Management Controller<\/a>. One of the issues that a reset could fix is that the battery does not appear to be charging properly. <\/p>\n<p>To reset the controller, perform these steps (as documented on the Apple Support web site):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shut down your laptop completely. <\/li>\n<li>Plug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the MacBook if its not already connected. <\/li>\n<li>On the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time.&#160; [Wow, it\u2019s awkward to do that! I pressed the S-C-O keys first and then the power button and it worked]<\/li>\n<li>Release all the keys and the power button at the same time. <\/li>\n<li>Press the power button to turn on the computer.&#160; <strong>       <br \/>Note<\/strong>: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A few moments after I performed the steps above, the mag safe LED light switched to an orange color (charging) and the battery indicator no longer blinked 5 times quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Problem resolved, and much simpler than taking it to a local Apple \u201cGenius\u201d bar.<\/p>\n<p><em>As this wasn\u2019t an obvious fix, I\u2019ve decided to put this on my blog in the hope that someone else might find it useful, and so when I have this happen again, I don\u2019t need to go hunting for the solution! <img style=\"border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none\" class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile\" alt=\"Smile\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/wlEmoticon-smile6.png\" \/><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The non replaceable battery on my Macbook Pro (2010) had discharged recently completely as I\u2019d left the laptop unplugged for more than a month without turning it on.
