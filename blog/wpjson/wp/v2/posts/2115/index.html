If you&#8217;re on a domain joined computer, or occasionally update your password like you should, there&#8217;s a reasonable chance that the password you use for Bash is different than the one you use for general access to your PC. In fact, it&#8217;s probably likely.<\/p>\n<p>Since I have a number of Windows boxes I frequently use, I wanted to create a password that while different from machine to machine, would be easy to remember (and not the same from machine to machine). However, the password I&#8217;d wanted to use didn&#8217;t always meet the default password requirements.<\/p>\n<p>So, here&#8217;s what I did.
