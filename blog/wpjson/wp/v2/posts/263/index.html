This is not to say they do a perfect job, but I understand it&#8217;s a pretty nightmarish task to design a new OS when you&#8217;re so constrained by history. (I&#8217;ve read rumours that Windows 7 will tackle backward compatibility in a very different way, meaning that to run fully natively vendors will have to recompile. I guess this is similar to how Apple managed OS X, but I don&#8217;t know any details or even whether the rumours are accurate.) Similarly Java has hundreds or thousands of deprecated methods now &#8211; and .NET has plenty, too. At least there <i>is<\/i> a road towards planned obsolescence on both platforms, but it takes a long time to reach fruition. (How many of the deprecated Java APIs have actually been removed?)&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>He mentions SMTP as a technology that he might like to kill. I doubt it will go away any time soon &#8211; as there are too many systems depending on it today. The most likely thing to happen is that it&#8217;s replaced with something better, slowly. That technology\/API\/protocol becomes popular enough to displace SMTP. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What&#8217;s the Perfect API?
