I was doing a bit of packing for an upcoming trip (trying to see what would fit, what wouldn&#8217;t) &#8212; and after filling my backpack with the <em>necessities <\/em>and hefting it onto my back, my wife turned to me and pointed out how heavy the backpack looked. <\/p>\n<p>I emptied the various nooks and crannies to see what I was actually carrying. I&#8217;ll spare you a photograph of the pandemonium that is my backpack, but I will say that if your bag contains things like mine (did), it might be time to lighten the load:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Network crossover adapter<\/strong>. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve ever used this.<\/li>\n<li><strong>USB extension cable<\/strong>. Neat, but again, I cannot think of a time I&#8217;ve needed to extend a USB cable while on a trip. I should leave this in my den\/office where it might actually come in handy!<\/li>\n<li><strong>USB male-female inverter thingy<\/strong>. You&#8217;d think there had been a USB emergency at some point for me to carry this.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Three mini-to-full sized USB cables. <\/strong>I only have 2 USB ports on my laptop. It&#8217;s rare that I need more than one thing plugged in at a time while traveling.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Wireless mouse &amp; wired mouse<\/strong>. I&#8217;ll stick to the wired mouse &#8212; it&#8217;s for travel anyway. I leave a wireless mouse at work. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Over $4 in change. <\/strong>Yeah, just in case someone needs change or there&#8217;s a vending machine that won&#8217;t take bills or a credit card. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Airport Express. <\/strong>When hotels didn&#8217;t have wireless, this was useful. Now, it&#8217;s just dead weight.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A unopened box of sleeping pills<\/strong>. This was for a trip a year and a half ago. But I&#8217;ve been carrying them around just in case I&#8217;m too wide awake&#8230;.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Various ailments related to digestion<\/strong>&#8230; (I had a bad case of food poisoning at the last PDC which inspired me to always have these on hand).<\/li>\n<li><strong>2 USB memory sticks<\/strong>. One 8GB and the other 2GB. <\/li>\n<li><strong>6 cough drops. <\/strong>Hack, hack, hack. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Bandages<\/strong>. Maybe I&#8217;ll get a nasty cut from an extra usb cable &#8230;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Dental floss<\/strong>. (Just a small package &#8212; I can&#8217;t decide if this should stay or go).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>What&#8217;s the silliest thing you carry around that you don&#8217;t need? I&#8217;m not a pack-rat at all &#8230; so I find it funny that I&#8217;ve been carrying around all of this unnecessary weight for so long!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My backback I carry daily and on trips was extra heavy this morning.
