					<description><![CDATA[Aaron,

You are spot on with your doubts about the next version of VS. Blend SUCKS for me on a remote desktop session, even if I select the LAN option (10Mbps). I wonder if VS10 will be any better, we can just hope...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Keep in mind that there will likely be many other things done under the covers.  So, perhaps a WPF UI will not be so bad.  Yes, just replacing the current UI with a WPF UI would be an issue as there are many performance problems with large solutions.  But, if the underlying architecture was changed to optimize performance then a WPF based UI would give you more benefits than drawbacks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My understanding is that although WPF was designed with it in mind, very little of what was intended actually shipped. They don&#039;t do the remoting as they had originally intended at all.

Blend is sluggish on my machines -- so I hope that doesn&#039;t represent future VS performance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WPF was designed with Remote Desktop in mind.  If I understand correctly, it is capable of remoting only the visual tree and taking advantage of the client&#039;s CPU/GPU.

I would also note that the only other &quot;real&quot; or &quot;giant&quot; WPF application from Microsoft is Blend, essentially a dev tool.]]></description>
