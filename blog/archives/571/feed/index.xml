					<description><![CDATA[Michael -- I&#039;m interested to hear why you say Silverlight is anything but several years behind a Flash/Flex combo. What&#039;s specifically missing? And does Silverlight has those features? My experience with Silverlight LOB applications has shown it&#039;s not generally ready for prime time. 

Microsoft and Adobe are clearly gunning for the same space (the same square).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s wrong to say SL is &quot;years behind&quot; flash/flex - there may be some missing UI elements the flex has over SL, but having experience in using flex for more than a website game and using it as a corporate lob app has shown huge holes in flex&#039;s capabilities (and that adobe still has features in flash that require you to buy adobe servers to get).  

I think people want to compare flex and SL head-to-head because they both &quot;run in a square&quot;, but I think as time goes on it will become clear that they are suited for completely different roles]]></description>
