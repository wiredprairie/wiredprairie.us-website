					<description><![CDATA[I also recently switched from WHS2011 to Windows 8. Loving no-ip.com as well! Its a suitable replacement for the built in functionality of WHS2011.

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/index.php/archives/1773/comment-page-1#comment-20361&quot;&gt;David Hollifield&lt;/a&gt;.

I haven&#039;t had the problem you&#039;re having with streamed/ripped DVDs (as I haven&#039;t tried it). However, my thought on that would be to potentially store the DVD images on a non-Storage Space drive (so you get better speed potentially), and use File History to back them up to another drive. I&#039;m using File History in a similar way (but not for media files like you suggest).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice setup. I have a lot of the same. Yours is more elaborate and I&#039;m going to borrow ideas. One question though. I also recently upgraded my WHS 2011 to Windows 8 Pro. I very much like Windows 8, but found the Storage Spaces to be unusable as a source of streaming movies. I use My Movies to stream ripped DVDs from my server to my HTPC and this just would not work with Storage Spaces. It would play for a few seconds then just stop. I removed the Storage Spaces and streaming worked again. Have you experienced anything like that?]]></description>
