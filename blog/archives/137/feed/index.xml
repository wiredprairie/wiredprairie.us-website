					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all of your comments so far. 

John -- all Apple needs to do is to uncheck Safari by default.  Opt-In.

Are any of you annoyed when you download something like Java and it includes, by default, the Google Toolbar? There are a lot of downloads that include the Google Toolbar, and they are opt-out, not opt-in by default.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess we have different understanding of the words &#039;Force me&#039;.

Apple is not forcing you. You can uncheck the box and if that annoys you to do too, you can select &#039;Ignore update&#039; from the menu and you should never see Safari again.

So as far as I can tell, the choice is indeed yours. The only thing they&#039;re forcing you to do is to make your choice.

I completely understand why you don&#039;t like Safari, it doesn&#039;t look like a windows application and looks out of place. I bet if Apple made it using Windows native widgets, then more people would accept it.

But that doesn&#039;t change the fact that they&#039;re not wrong in offering it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John -- I scanned thru the link you pointed to. I don&#039;t go so far as suggesting Apple can&#039;t advertise new software. But proactively pushing it is still wrong in my opinion. 

Maybe I&#039;d be more interested in Safari if it acted like a good Windows citizen. But, I have the same complaint about iTunes. I know Apple does this to keep the Apple/Mac brand ... but it&#039;s too bad as the UI suffers inconsistencies on the PC that make it unnecessarily difficult to use.  

And although having it on your box doesn&#039;t force you to use it, it&#039;s one more thing that will need updates, it&#039;s one more thing in &quot;Start/Programs&quot; menu, it&#039;s just clutter. 

I don&#039;t mind choice -- but I want freedom of choice. Don&#039;t force me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Ella - if browsers were standards compliant -- and implemented the standards identically, AND they were all bug free, then I wouldn&#039;t mind having more than one browser. 

But, why do we need more than one browser if they all implement the same standards identically and all perform adaquately? Or -- why would any typical web user care? I don&#039;t need more than one web browser. Plug-ins? Average users don&#039;t use plug-ins.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;How many browsers can a web developer support reliably?&quot;

If the browser is built to standards then the number is unlimited.  Of course that leaves out Internet Explorer doesn&#039;t it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wish Apple would find a way to entice more users to actually USE Safari. While Apple may get Safari on windows boxes, it doesn&#039;t mean that those users will actually use it. Yes, you read that right, despite what you&#039;ve heard or read, having Safari on your hard drive doesn&#039;t force you to use it.

I am a web developer and my biggest wish is for Safari, Firefox, Opera and IE to each have a 25% share of the browser market. 

This guy said it better than I could:

					<description><![CDATA[Although IE may have been riddled with many bugs over the years ... it has helped to create a market for higher quality browsers. 

Yes, there may be bugs, but they don&#039;t affect most users. IE is good enough. And that&#039;s all most people need from a web browser, &quot;good enough.&quot; Maybe that&#039;s a sad state, but I can hardly blame them.

Thanks for your comments!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With my software developer hat on, I agree with the spirit of what &#039;slaws&#039; suggests -- that we need to protect the clueless. 

I don&#039;t blame them. For everything I know about computers, I know one less thing about how the engine in my car works. I don&#039;t worry about it. I get in and go. Many computer users just want to understand their computers at the same level.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Choice is a often bad thing for web developers. How many browsers can a web developer support reliably? Even if all browsers implement some level of CSS/HTML compliance, a good web development shop still will test the various options to confirm there aren&#039;t any issues. And, that takes time and energy. What&#039;s also annoying for web developers is that some standards are left to interpretation -- they aren&#039;t hard and fast rules. So, any browser may choose to implement a standard as they see fit.]]></description>
