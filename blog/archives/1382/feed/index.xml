					<description><![CDATA[I had same problem with the nest, registering i warmer temp than what it really was, by 5 degrees..   after leaving it plugged in for 1 day.. the battery is now fully charged and the temp has moved to dead on, compared to my 3 other therm&#039;s.  GREAT PRODUCT, but they should tell ppl it can take longer than 10minutes to neutralize the readout.. 1whole day in my case..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi David

Have you had any luck with your 2 degree temp discrepancy? I too have the same issue and nest just gives me the run around. I have insulated it the wall behind the nest, made sure it is out of direct sunlight, ran a c wire. Still constantly higher than my older thermostat and 4 other thermometers. Nest support told me they are aware of the problem and that I should just live with it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read about the Nest in the Wall Street Journal back in November or earlier.  It sounded great for my shore house, and just what I wanted to control the temperature via the internet.  Tried to buy a Nest at Christmas but they were &quot;sold out&quot;.  Put my name on the waiting list in January, but never heard from Nest, not even an email confirmation that I am on the list.  Finally called tonight, and it sounded like I was talking to a scam artist.  No explanation as to why I have not heard anything, other than they are very popular and have limited supply.  Who can&#039;t build a mehanical device nowadays - outsource to China or India and they would have piles of these things.

I am taking a pass on the Nest and will search for other internet controllable thermostats.  Hey, at least it looks nice.

Good luck to all you Nest owners, and thanks for this blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have had the nest for about 3 weeks now.  I&#039;ve been happy with it but I will admit I&#039;m not nearly as obsessive about exact temps etc as some of you guys (not to imply that is a bad thing).  I travel a great deal and so for me being able to access the Nest remotely via my phone was the big selling point.  I found other thermostats that allowed this but they required me to leave a PC on in my home while out of town.  The only issue I&#039;ve seen happened this AM.  I got up and the thermostat had reset itself like it lost power  I assumed that if it lost power it would just come back up ready to go where it left off.  I had to perform the full setup like it was brand new.  The critical issue is that I did not lose power last night.  None of my clocks were reset so not sure what happened with the Nest.  I&#039;ll have to just keep watching to see if this happens again.  Anyone else have this happen?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was thinking about a Nest Thermostat but have changed my mind! I was plesantly surprised when I installed a Honeywell Vision Pro and it was able to anticipate the time to turn the boiler on for my Minnesota frosty winter wake-ups. Boilers are notoriously difficult for working with prediction algorithms, the old Chronotherm III was abysmal. If I do replace the Vision Pro, it will be with the new Honeywell Presige with the wireless outdoor temp and remote control! Thanks for all the helpful feedback!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My Nest thermostat worked for 4 days.  Then problems.  It ended up blowing out the control board in my furnace.  Then the replacement.  I ended up getting replacing it with the old Honeywell that has worked so well for so long.  I got my money back, but they&#039;re completely ignoring me after they refunded the purchase price.  I&#039;m still pretty mad about this.

Some, at least, of their support people don&#039;t know anything about electronics.  Because I was concerned about it being powered from the furnace&#039;s 24V line, I asked them how much power the Nest thermostat dissipates, I was told &quot;24V.&quot;  I tried to clarify and asked him again, how much current does it draw?  He had no clue. I asked what the spec sheet said for max current draw and was told that they don&#039;t have a spec sheet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t set the away temperature to 58F or 60F. It always switches it to a lower/higher value. Anyone else seeing that in the web interface currently?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did the high-level reset per Nest&#039;s support person, to see if some of my problems could be solved. Nope. Among other things, the Energy panel says its been partly cloudy and raining for the past three days - not even this is correct. Of course, the implication that the Nest is clever enough to use this information is false. The next step would be the low-level reset, which would restore the unit to its as-received state. I&#039;m going to return it instead. It is properly labeled an 0.8 version - not all the functionality is present in the code, and there are unfinished aspects to the code that is.
Nest showed great attention to detail in its look and feel, in its marketing materials, in its website (which is labeled beta), the apps - but just beneath the surface of the unit itself, it&#039;s a mess. A very bad way to start, it seems to me.]]></description>
