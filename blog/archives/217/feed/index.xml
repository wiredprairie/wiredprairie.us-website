					<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re &quot;in&quot; to the principles of one GIANT page -- then SPI probably fits -- but I certainly don&#039;t buy into it -- feels like the wrong way to go for nearly any web application. 
Thanks for your comments! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with DrPizza, but having to build that idle code and restarting the counter every time is a pain.

Is there any benefit to and SPI?  It might be good for enterprises, then you throw in the fact that only a few developers can work on it, and you screwed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;idle&quot; for the purposes of a web page is surely easy?  It&#039;s idle if there are no clicks on the page and no typing, both of which are (in principle) fairly easily trappable.

					<description><![CDATA[DrPizza -- detecting idle is the tricky part -- it&#039;s too bad that the browser can&#039;t natively provide that information efficiently.

Big enterprise class SAN hard disks are anything but cheap -- but I&#039;d definitely agree that just making the thing scale better (maybe caching, more RAM, etc.) would be better than making the user understand the concept of Session.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Surely the simplest and best solution is to just refresh less often when idle and buy a server that can cope with 1 refresh every 20 minutes from all the idle sessions?  It might be worth making sessions last longer (session state can be dumped into a database anyway, and hard disks are cheap) so that refreshes can be more infrequent, but that&#039;s a minor detail.]]></description>
