					<description><![CDATA[We had this issue in an old version of Inbox2 (actually a bug in wpf), you should try reinstalling with the latest version from www.inbox2.com, and hey its free and will remain free :-)

Take care,

I had seen inbox2 (and I&#039;ve got it installed) -- but having just purchased PostBox, I&#039;m not too compelled to switch to something else. I just started it up as a reminder -- and it has hung on the splash screen for more than a minute. :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

Have you already seen Inbox2? www.inbox2.com, its a totally new email client which tries to do things differently. Still in beta but we hope quite useful already.

And guess what its built in WPF and actually contains some sample code found on this very blog :-)

Take care,

Waseem]]></description>
