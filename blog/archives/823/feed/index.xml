					<description><![CDATA[You might be able to script something up using LAME, an open source MP3 encoder.  I&#039;ve used it in the past to recode my collection on the fly for streaming (back in the time when I had ISDN).  There are a good number of settings you can configure (you might google a bit for a UI to LAME, as it&#039;s a command line tool), I&#039;d recommend 128 or 96 VBR and maybe try as low as 64 VBR depending on how she listens to songs from her iPod - if it&#039;s just with the standard ear buds and in the car, she probably won&#039;t notice much, if any quality loss.]]></description>
