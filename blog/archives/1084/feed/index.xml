					<description><![CDATA[Oh.  It looks like XAML tags don&#039;t come through in your comments.  Sorry about that.

The problem is that the control won&#039;t build for WP7 with this tag in place:
ei:ExtendedVisualStateManager

Because the ExtendedVisualStateManager is SL4 specific.

And then (I don&#039;t know if this is related) if I take the ExtendedVisualStateManager out, this line results in a NULL at runtime:

 _partContainer = this.GetTemplateChild(&quot;PART_Container&quot;) as Panel;

even if I take out the cast to Panel, it is still null.

I see you are doing WP7 stuff now, too, so I thought you might have a better idea than I do on how to work around the SL4 specific stuff.

Thanks!
