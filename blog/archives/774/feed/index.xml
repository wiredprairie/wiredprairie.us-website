					<description><![CDATA[This made me laugh. I can maybe look past the crappy image and the crappy resolution, but the drag-and-drop-into-circle part takes the cake. So, are you human?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/index.php/archives/774/comment-page-1#comment-2554&quot;&gt;Ben Vanik&lt;/a&gt;.

Maybe a bot could do that -- although it would be easy enough to move the images around and then use a simple instruction like, click the pencil, then click the phone. I&#039;d certainly like to make the &quot;captchas&quot; easier as I find I can&#039;t read about 30-40% of them.  But, as you said, they can make the bot do pretty much anything so it really doesn&#039;t serve much purpose.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My guess is because it&#039;d be easier for a bot to recognize the images and simulate a click than to drag them. Of course, if someone goes through the effort to do the matching, doing the drag is probably pretty easy, too.

Wonder if this is iPhone compatible, though - I know there are drag/drop issues with missing DOM events...]]></description>
