					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/index.php/archives/805/comment-page-1#comment-2691&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;.

True -- it&#039;s interesting to see that many people are already asking the question: &quot;what other applications will I be able to install -- it&#039;s Linux, so anything should work....&quot; and so on. My understanding is that Google doesn&#039;t want that initially -- they want it pure, and fast -- and WEB. (Plus, I believe it&#039;s a different window system, so it wouldn&#039;t necessarily work with KDE, etc. based applications).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As far as hardware support goes, I think the answer might simply be that those who want to do that kind of thing should look elsewhere. They aren&#039;t required to handle all the hardware thrown at them. Then again, perhaps hardware manufacturers will have to take Linux seriously if the OS grabs a decent market share.

The Netbook market quickly went from being &quot;small, internet capable PCs&quot; to &quot;small, full featured laptop&quot; and I think Google recognizes that. 

In addition, I think that Google&#039;s Native Client has something to do with this venture in to Linux and a largely web based OS. http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/]]></description>
