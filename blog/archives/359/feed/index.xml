					<description><![CDATA[David -- thanks for the explanation. I experiment with every version of Opera as it comes out, but usually some of my favorite sites (or needed sites) don&#039;t work, so I abandon it (as I&#039;d rather not have multiple browser applications open unless absolutely necessary). :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jon -- try going to that page and navigating around the content for PowerShell. You can&#039;t. It doesn&#039;t work (the drop down&#039;s don&#039;t work and with the tree not in the right place, I can&#039;t get to the other Powershell related content).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[wow, what a terrible reason to not use opera. who goes to msdn to browse the tree anyway?

seriously, i&#039;ve been using opera for the last year and the main reason i use it is because it is soo much snappier and faster than any other browser on the market (yes, even ff3). once you use opera for a significant period of time, anything else feels significantly more sluggish.]]></description>
