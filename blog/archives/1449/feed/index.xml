Hmm. Surprised it doesn&#039;t work on WP8 (as that&#039;s supposed to be IE9, basically). Are you trying to create an WP7/8 App, or a web site that you can browse from your phone?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Aaron - The web site works horribly on wp7/8 (not really usable) and nest have no plans to support at the moment.   I&#039;m looking to create a simple app to turn on/off and move temp up/down.   I only have a single Nest.

I&#039;ve done .net development - just not much in the way of web stuff.]]></description>

@spotty -- do you have a question/comment? 

I&#039;m guessing Nest won&#039;t have a WP experience. Does the web site via the mobile browser work on WP7/8?]]></description>

No, sorry, there&#039;s not a simple way to connect the two without more work. I&#039;ve never tried it on the Mac. In theory, using Mono (.NET for Mac), it might work with some tweaks. Not sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These seems way out of my league as you coding geniuses have seemed to crack open the nut that I&#039;ve been hoping someone would crack open. Nest is wonderful.  I have a home automation system (Insteon mostly) that is aching to interface with it.  

I&#039;m not exactly sure how to run the projects listed above.  I&#039;m not a coder, though I am pretty handy around technology and not a complete idiot, but this seems to be quite complicated.  I&#039;m on a mac, so not sure if JSON even works.  Downloaded something called Objectify (JSON client for mac) but it doesn&#039;t seem to want to open any of the files in your GitHub project.  Please forgive my cluelessness, but any simple way to fire this up so I can send variables to my Home Auto system?

Thanks in advance for your patience.
