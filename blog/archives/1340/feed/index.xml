					<description><![CDATA[I have undefloor radiant heating and installed two Nest thermostats a couple of weeks ago hoping that the combination of learning and &#039;time to temperature&#039; features meant that I would be able to say &quot;Please ensure the house is at 70F by 6am each morning&quot; rather than &quot;Please turn on the heat at 6am and wait 5-6 hours to get back up to temperature&quot;  

I&#039;m agree completely that Nest dropped the ball on this.  The thermostat already knows the outdoor temp, has learned how quickly my room heats up and knows what temperature I usually *want* it to be when I wake up.

WHY IS IT TOO HARD TO JUST TURN THE HEAT ON AT THE RIGHT TIME??]]></description>

Whoops -- by vacation I meant &quot;vacation day.&quot; I believe our previous wifi thermostat had the concept of a holiday/vacation day, where you were home and outside of a normal routine, so maybe on a weekday, you wanted the heat to be set higher for example, without futzing over using &quot;hold&quot; or some other similar feature.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, there is a vacation mode called &quot;Away&quot;. See the support article called &quot;I&#039;m going on vacation&quot;. Overrides the auto-away function, and will ignore a house cleaner or neighbor watering the plants.
Good luck.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/index.php/archives/1340/comment-page-1#comment-3731&quot;&gt;GregN&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for your comments. It&#039;s interesting to hear that others aren&#039;t enamored by the learning features yet.
 
However, I&#039;d be disappointed to turn off learning mode as that&#039;s one of the supposedly awesome features. :(

I noticed yesterday that the &quot;learning mode&quot; was again confused by a few days of different routines. It really needs a &quot;vacation&quot; mode. That would solve the majority of the issues I&#039;m having with the learning and auto adjustments it is making. I noticed yesterday that one of the thermostats announced, &quot;Auto away worked and saved X.&quot; Huh? Apparently, the furnace had run during the day for some strange reason (as it had on Monday and Tuesday). So, it &quot;saved&quot; us by running the furnace for 3 hours apparently while we were away and then deciding we weren&#039;t there, and turning the temperature down.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Early adopter here too, with a few of the same problems:
Installed on Dec.11 and we left for a few days on the 12th. Kept an eye on it remotely, adjusted when needed, and set a schedule for all 7 days. After a few days a message popped up saying it didn&#039;t have enough data to enable the &quot;away&quot; function, but still learning. No problem, figured our absence delayed the learning curve. After about a week and a half, our set schedule was changed. Half the weeknight &quot;sleep&quot; settings were missing for no apparent reason. Checked the support site, found the piece about &quot;Learning Pause&quot;. Guessed that would prevent future unwanted changes, but called Support to confirm:
Nice guy, he could see my previous settings, erasure of same, and re-set schedule. Didn&#039;t sound so sure about &quot;learning pause&quot;, but he said to try it and gave me a case # for future if needed. Been a week now with learning off, and the schedule is spot on so far. The nice thing about &#039;learning pause&#039; is that manual or remote adjustments are activated but not remembered. Reverts back to schedule at the right time(s). Yes, my Learning Thermostat is no longer learning, but I&#039;m happy that it&#039;s no longer teaching itself how to mess up the schedule I want!
Overall, I still say this is going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread for most people, especially the 80% with programmable thermos that have never used the features (though we always have). It IS beautiful, and I don&#039;t regret the purchase at all.
Thanks for your post and thoughts.
Happy New Year!]]></description>
