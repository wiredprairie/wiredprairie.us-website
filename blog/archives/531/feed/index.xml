					<description><![CDATA[Doesn&#039;t seem like much of a moral dilemma to me.  The scenario states that the co-workers are your good friends.  I find it hard to believe that many would cause this kind of hardship to their friends, for 10x their salary.

I think that it would be a more interesting scenario to me, if your friends did not know that you accepted the money.  My choice would be the same, but might make some think more about accepting the deal.

Also, might be interesting with the original scenario to consider how many times your salary it would take to accept that deal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d take the money and give each of the three twice the annual salary so they have about 24 month to look for a new job. They&#039;re already thinking about leaving our  employer, so I would do them a favor :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It depends on how much I like my co-workers.  If they were jackasses and made my life sooo miserable for me to come to work everyday then yes I&#039;d take it without blinking.  

On the other hand if they were always friendly/nice, had kids, a spouse, mortgages then I most likely won&#039;t take it since I&#039;m making enough already.]]></description>
