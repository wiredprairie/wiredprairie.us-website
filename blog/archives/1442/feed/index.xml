					<description><![CDATA[@Suman: If you are making a request via JavaScript, then yes, you won&#039;t be able to do it. Your browser has &quot;origin&quot; restrictions and the Nest servers  do too. Meaning, you can&#039;t make a cross-site request.

If you are making the request with a server side language, the request are fairly straight to make. I&#039;ve been working on a PHP library the last few days to encapsulate some of the requests.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry, by IP range, I mean they are probably doing IP filtering, but come to think of it, that can&#039;t be right since I&#039;m able to reach the web site.

I&#039;ve even written a utility to read the initial hit and add all the sent cookies to the request. I&#039;m still unable to make the request work.

Maybe someone could try Fiddler to test?]]></description>

I don&#039;t understand what you mean? Their &quot;IP Range&quot;? 

It&#039;s possible they&#039;ve changed the protocol or authentication since I wrote this up. I was just doing some stuff recently with a node.js based API that I was working on. It was working, but I admit I was rethinking auth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think they block anything that&#039;s not from their IP range, unfortunately, so you can&#039;t really connect unless you packet sniff from your host device. I&#039;ve tried to connect and although I&#039;ve set up all the right stuff, it won&#039;t connect. :(]]></description>

@Randal - thanks for the link. One thermostat was definitely defective as it read incorrectly in two locations in our house and consistently read much higher than 2 proven thermometers (4-6 degrees F warmer). It would report 74F when it was impossible that it was 74F (as it&#039;s a cool enough winter that our house is never that warm and the thermostat was set to 68F). I certainly can believe that there&#039;s some inaccuracy in other thermostats.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not that this directly relates to your case, Aaron, it looks like your issue was isolated to your Nest thermostat. But I found an article from another blog that might explain some, not all, of these temperature readings you&#039;re seeing. http://davidwallen.net/2012/01/nest-learning-thermostat-initial-data/]]></description>
