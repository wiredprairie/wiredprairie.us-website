I really like VMware Workstation 7+, as it intelligently supports multi-monitors. (The VM is aware of the configuration and isn&#039;t just artificially stretched).]]></description>

Robert -- it doesn&#039;t seem to be that. My total screen resolution isn&#039;t listed. It&#039;s only the resolution for the &quot;current&quot; screen. 

There is no meaningful resolution for multiple monitors other than a total number of pixels. Unless you have identical resolutions and exact alignment -- you might end up with dimensions that far exceed your monitors capabilities. (I have a 1920x1280 + 1280x1024 monitor). One sits lower than the other due to the stands. Further, I can&#039;t draw a bounding rectangle and compute a total screen resolution (especially since my primary monitor has more pixels in height than my secondary monitor).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Currently I run a VM at work that supports multi monitor, but in reality just stretches the desktop across both screens and maximizes the window.  I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s what you are seeing (my monitors aren&#039;t identical either, so I&#039;m probable a weird screen size too)]]></description>
