					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/index.php/archives/917/comment-page-1#comment-4858&quot;&gt;Thorsten&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks for the suggestions Thorsten.

I recently bought the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4210001&quot; title=&quot;Tumi Slim Solutions Brief Pack&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tumi Slim Solutions Brief Pack (black)&lt;/a&gt; and like it a lot! While it&#039;s not Made in the US (which was one of my original goals), I abandoned that as I really wanted a new bag that fit my needs and I didn&#039;t want to settle just for American made if it didn&#039;t have the style and features I needed. I was in a Tumi store and had the opportunity to examine the Tumi closely, which really helped me make up my mind.

I&#039;ve had a Crumpler as a photography bag and while it&#039;s a nice bag, the styling of their bags isn&#039;t really something I like well enough to carry every day (they&#039;re a bit too casual and frumpy). I&#039;ve never seen a Booq bag in person (I wish I could have!)-- I like their style, but the bags when empty always seem heavy for their size. I do like the styling and size of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booqbags.com/us/backpacks/boa-squeeze/BSQ-BLR&quot; title=&quot;BOA Squeeze&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, thanks for the structured and &quot;matter of fact&quot; review. I was considering the Tom Bihn vs. a Booq vs.  a Crumpler.
Maybe the latter two brands have an option for you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just to add a new option: RickshawBags (http://www.rickshawbags.com/). I had a chance to be in their Factory Store recently in SF, CA and looked at a few of their bags. In particular, I was interested in the Skinny Laptop Backpack. I liked it overall. The price was reasonable. The only issue I had with it that prevented me from ordering one on the spot was the laptop holder. It&#039;s removable, with velcro. Although I do travel by plane with some regularity, I couldn&#039;t see trying to rip the laptop holder out of the bag -- as the velcro connection was quite strong. 

Further, the fact that it&#039;s removable takes up space in the bag (as it&#039;s a standalone compartment). It was a nice bag. 

That one feature has made me hesitate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you ever travel with a DSLR, I think you REALLY ought to check out the Brain Bag. They just came out with a new camera insert to hold DSLRs, lenses, etc..., and it&#039;s getting very nice reviews. I don&#039;t have anything more than a point and shoot so I don&#039;t need it, but the thing looks tight. You could put the brain cell/freudian slip and misc stuff in one compartment, and the camera insert in the other when needed and travel very comfortably with all of it. when not, just cinch things down and it won&#039;t feel like a huge bag. It&#039;s got length to it, but as it fills up it fills OUT, like away from your back. If you don&#039;t have much in it, it will retain a pretty low profile.

I&#039;m digging mine, your mileage may vary, but I looked at 7 bags now, including the Tumi Alpha Compact Laptop Brief Pack which Tumi sent me to replace my decayed briefcase. The Tumi is a very nice pack, but I&#039;m sticking with my Brain Bag. Gonna sell the Tumi on ebay, brand new with tags still on it. If you know anyone who wants a $395 Tumi pack for $250, I&#039;ll be listing it this weekend.

If you check out the Brain Bag, post a comment here, would enjoy reading your thoughts on it.  One thing I&#039;m also digging with it is the organizational paradigm they use. They give you SOME organization capability built into the bag, but it&#039;s not like Tumi with a million different compartments of various sizes. The organizer pouches are designed to provide flexible and adaptive storage, and that paradigm is really growing on me.]]></description>

Thanks Rick for the update!

Maybe I&#039;ll take a look at the Brain Bag again -- although it really is bigger than I think I need (and it really looks &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; in the photos on their web site). I hadn&#039;t noticed the &quot;Buzz&quot; before. I like the idea of the &quot;Buzz&quot; for day to day use, but not sure about a sling (as I&#039;ve had a backpack since collage). (And I know I&#039;d need a different bag when I want to throw my camera and a lens or two when I travel).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Aaron,

So I&#039;ve had the Brain Bag for about a month now. I LOVE this bag. My wife liked it, too, but wanted to try the Smart Alec and got that instead, so I&#039;ve had a chance to look over both. I couldn&#039;t use the Smart Alec, and for the reasons you described. Once I put the brain cell and freudian slip into the main compartment, there is still room for a lot more stuff but accessing it becomes a bit of a challenge. For her, it&#039;s perfect. She basically wants a pack to hold her 15&quot; macbook pro, then let her just stuff her purse into the compartment, and put some misc stuff in the outer pockets and she&#039;s good.

The Brain Bag does have a LOT of capacity. But what&#039;s cool is that with the compression straps, you can take a lot of &#039;slack&#039; out of the bag and it doesn&#039;t feel like this huge bag. I carry a 15&quot; macbook pro in a brain cell, I&#039;ve got a freudian slip loaded down with files, reading material, and misc stuff, and then a few things scattered in the other pockets but I&#039;m utilizing probably less than half the bag&#039;s organizational capacity.  For those times where I need to stash more into it, I can easily do it.

I was concerned it might feel too big as an every day carry bag, but for me it&#039;s not an issue. It&#039;s working very well. I would highly recommend that anyone looking for a quality laptop bag with good space and easy access to different compartments take a good look at the Brain Bag.

Hope that helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/index.php/archives/917/comment-page-1#comment-4189&quot;&gt;rick&lt;/a&gt;.

I settled on an REI backpack for around $80 that has a place for a laptop (and side access) and a handful of pockets. It&#039;s really lightweight when empty (which I&#039;m really thankful for). It expands really well but collapses down pretty well when empty. 

Is it my favorite backpack? No. :) Is it functional, yes. It&#039;s of course, not made in the USA which is what I really wanted, but I just couldn&#039;t find one that I liked that didn&#039;t seem to have more than a few questionable design choices. I had been looking at some of the smaller Tumi backpacks and really liked them over all, but just couldn&#039;t decide. :) 

If you find you like the Brain Bag, please add a comment here! My recollection was that it was just too big for day to day use as I don&#039;t really need to carry much (13&quot; laptop, iPad, pocket camera, cables, and a few laptop accessories and pens).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m late to the party, just stumbled across this review. Thanks for posting it. I&#039;ve been searching for a good backpack for every day use plus travel. Need to replace my Tumi briefcase that is starting to fall apart. Plus, I just want to transition to a backpack.

I ordered 5 different bags to try out with the idea of returning the 4 that didn&#039;t make the cut. One is the Tom Bihn Brain Bag, which hasn&#039;t arrived yet, gets here tomorrow, but seems like it might be better suited to your needs. Only slightly more expensive but far bigger.

Have you come across the Brenthaven Expandable Trek? That&#039;s my current favorite and the one the Brain Bag will be competing against. They make great stuff. Would be interested in hearing what you finally settled upon.]]></description>

Thanks for the idea -- I&#039;ve always wanted something that doesn&#039;t say, &quot;CAMERA BAG&quot; on it though, which is what I&#039;m often worried about when I&#039;m carrying a camera manufacturer bag internationally (out of the USA).  I admit to not have looked recently though. So maybe things have changed.]]></description>
