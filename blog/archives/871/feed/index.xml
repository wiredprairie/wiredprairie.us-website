Good points. My ranting was inconsistent. Hopefully rectified that with a few tweaks as I realized those other languages were old as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why do you complain that JavaScript, as a language, was first released in 1995? A selection (from Wikipedia):

C - 1972
C++ - 1983
Objective-C - 1986
Python - 1991
Ruby - 1995
Java - 1995
PHP - 1995

C# is the only mainstream programming language I can think of right now from &quot;this century&quot; (Visual Basic&#039;s root as a language are much older). So why complain about the age of JS, but not mention Java, which is just as old (or even 4 years older, if you count Oak)?

Debugging is a problem since there&#039;s no single vendor for JS &quot;solutions&quot; as there is for C#, where the language designers and tools developers interact. Hasn&#039;t stopped the rest of the world from developing great stuff in JS, PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, or even C++ (a language in which the MS developer tools fail miserably compared to the C#/.NET tools).

It also seems you compare JavaScript to Silverlight. One is a framework, the other a programming language with a rather minimalistic default library. That&#039;s why there are many libraries, some of them good, for it. Just have a look at Cappucino and the Atlas demo. Great stuff, all of it JS (and they implemented a new Objective-C-like syntax on top of it, which is even older!)

I am not a fan of JavaScript either, but I think you mistakenly attribute many of the pitfalls in JS development to the language.]]></description>
