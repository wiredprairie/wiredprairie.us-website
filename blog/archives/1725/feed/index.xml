					<description><![CDATA[As an update ... I contacted Gander Mountain TWICE via their Internet customer support page -- and didn&#039;t even receive even an acknowledgement that they cared at all or &quot;thanks for the feedback.&quot;

So, my opinion of them and their business stands.

(We ended up going to another very friendly &quot;local&quot; shop that had similar services. While it wasn&#039;t as polished, we only had to sign a safety waiver.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the warning. It&#039;s as if the over-the-top absurd EULA (End User License Agreements) have now found their way into the real world.

There are many other retailers out there happy to take our money without this nonsense. I&#039;ll steer clear of GM.]]></description>
