					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Aaron. Javascript must include 3 decimal points on the time or something as compared to PHP. What I ended up doing was just dividing the timestamp by 1000 and then it works fine with the PHP date function.

I&#039;ve now got my PHP program working pretty nicely in that it outputs either RSS format or HTML format for displaying in a browser. I&#039;ve got it so I can pass in warning temperatures for low and high and it will include a warning message in the output.

My goal is to get IfThisThenThat (ifttt.com) to monitor the RSS for warning and text me if one is triggered. It should check periodically for a new item in the RSS feed and check for the keyword &quot;Warning&quot; without me having to run my PHP recursively. 

Thanks again for turning me on to the Nest API and providing the details needed to be able to make sense of the data! I didn&#039;t want to have to mess with node.js and this has been a fun little PHP project.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for posting this. It has been instrumental to me in writing a simpler PHP/Curl based program to read the thermostat&#039;s temperatures. 

I&#039;m finding very strange timestamp values in the json response, though. Do you have any idea which key has the actual timestamp that the thermostat last reported its temperature? I would have assumed the &quot;shared&quot; key which is the only place where the current temp is stored. However, the timestamps have way too high of numbers in them reporting the year as 44971 instead of 2013. The timestamps in the &quot;track&quot; and other keys are similarly large.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cool. I just set up my home automation to put my nest to away mode whenever I put my alarm to away. I found the auto-away a bit too slow to figure it out. So this should work much better. Thanks!]]></description>
