					<description><![CDATA[Attached properties are a viable and often preferable alternative to markup extensions (as a matter of fact, the lookup example at hardcodet.net could be implemented that easily with an AP that I even mentioned it). You rarely need to mess with markup extensions, but they can come in handy. I&#039;m thinking about simplified XAML (a lot of controls that use the same bindings, converters etc.) and scenarios where you would have to use several attached properties (which might cause you headache when it comes to state management). Apart from that, I&#039;d say you probably know that you need an extension if all alternatives just suck :).]]></description>
