					<description><![CDATA[You can only grab the ellipse because that&#039;s what&#039;s handling the mouse down currently.

					<description><![CDATA[Also, I found I couldn&#039;t make this work until I put:
 AllowsTransparency=&quot;True&quot;

I changed the window area to:

WindowStyle=&quot;None&quot; AllowsTransparency=&quot;True&quot;

It turns out you don&#039;t need the Background=&quot;Transparent&quot;.  The AllowsTransparency handles that (I think).

But I was curious, if I put the background to green in the Grid. You can&#039;t see through it and you can grab the corners of the window outside of the ellipse (which you can&#039;t do if it is transparent).  Why can I grab and move the window inside the elipse (which is also transparent) and not the outside corners?

Thanks,

Tom]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right.

I had missed that part.  When you say the origin of the gradient changed you meant the white part (circle) inside of the black circle would change position - which it does and the whole circle moves as well.

Thanks,

Tom]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/index.php/archives/837/comment-page-1#comment-2852&quot;&gt;Tshad&lt;/a&gt;.

That&#039;s what the code does -- it moves the gradient to where ever the mouse is during the mouse down, exactly as it says in the blog post. Is that what you mean?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I finally got it to work.

But when I did, I found that the gradient changed.  The white part of the circle (that starts out in the middle) moves to where ever the mouse is during the left mouse down.

Why does it do that?

Thanks,

Tom]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is it possible to get the download?

The page doesn&#039;t seem to be here.

I couldn&#039;t make the code work but I am just starting to use WPF.

Thanks,

Tom]]></description>
