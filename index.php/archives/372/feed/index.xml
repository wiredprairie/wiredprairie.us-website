					<description><![CDATA[Definately VIM.  It will take a time investment to become truly comfortable in it (first thing to do is turn off behave mswin), but once you do you will become more productive in your text editor than you can possibly imagine.  Text completion (ctrl-p, ctrl-n are your friends), incredibly powerful macros, and tons of other features (if you can get tags working, plus some of the auto commands you can run depending upon the filtype you will be amazed).  It is not quite as powerful under windows as it is in a Unix environment (grep, and tags support need some fiddling to get them working).  Find a good tutorial and start pluging away, you will be glad you did!]]></description>
