While it’s not a life-changing device, it’s been generally fun to wear. I’m always interested in the sleep tracking when I travel … “<em>Awake 16x, slept 5 hours.</em>”</p>
<p>Last night though, my wife’s Flex had stopped working. The lights wouldn’t show up when the device was tapped and when she used the charger, it wouldn’t begin to charge. I found a few recommendations to use rubber bands to hold the Flex into the charger, cleaning the contacts, and a few more. Cleaning the contacts didn’t help. The charger worked with my Flex, so that meant the rubber band trick wouldn’t help. </p>
<p>I found though on the <a href="https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1041329" target="_blank">Fitbit support website</a> this morning though a suggestion that worked! Apparently, you can restart/reset the tracker without loosing data. The steps are easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug your charging cable into a USB port and insert your Flex as you normally would.</li>
<li>Insert a paperclip into the small pinhole on the back of the charger (<em>I’d never noticed it before, it’s small!</em>)</li>
<li>Press gently on the pinhole for 3-4 seconds. You’ll feel a gentle ‘click’ when you’ve depressed it far enough (although my “one-thousand, two-thousand, three-thousand” count actually got to 6). The lights flashed a few times, and it started charging a few seconds later.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m posting this here as my searching the night before hadn’t turned up that specific support web site page. It may be because the web page is poorly titled and applies to four of their trackers.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quick update about a new bug/issue/feature in the Nest thermostat that I’ve encountered. </p>
<p>Here’s the before image:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/image.png" width="371" height="165" /></p>
<p>I’ve used the new Nest 2.0 software to set ranges for the various floors as you can see above. I captured that image on the 30th of May. </p>
<p>Here’s the image from this morning (4th of June):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 0px auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/image1.png" width="356" height="160" /></p>
<p>The first floor is set to <strong>Off</strong> as I neglected to take a screen shot before I adjusted the setting (and I’d turned the Basement back <strong>On </strong>earlier, so ignore that). </p>
<p>However, the First Floor had the same range as the Second Floor in the shot above (68-75F) before I switched it to <strong>Off</strong>. Yes, <em>automatically</em>, two of the active Nests had reset their range from my choice back to the defaults. That’s an expensive choice during the hot muggy summers of Wisconsin (or any time of the year). This is the second time this has actually happened. </p>
<p>It also happened while were were on vacation recently (but I hadn’t had visual evidence). The house went from a range of 62-84F to 68-75F. While I’m sure our house cat appreciated it, our electrical bill will not (as it was extremely hot while we were away).</p>
<p><em>And if you’re planning on trolling/flaming this post, don’t bother. I won’t publish it. </em></p>
