No, it&#039;s not available in any general location that I&#039;m aware of. You called Support and they don&#039;t answer?]]></description>

Are you asking about installing it from scratch somehow (rather than just a patch)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there, I followed your blog posts quite some time and consider a must read. Maybe you can help with this one: Do you know how to install software manually for the Nest through the USB cable. There are packages on http://www.nest.com/ca/legal/compliance/ that look like linux system files. Can I download those packages to my PC and install then through USB in my Nest? FYI: I received the Nest for free (can&#039;t disclose why and for what because of leagal reasons, sorry about that) and the tech guys taking care of my buggy Nest are slow to respond or maybe overworked =). I don&#039;t care about messing up the Nest as it is already messed up LOL. Or is it too complicated too accomplish that? I am not a programmer BTW. Looking forward to your feedack!]]></description>

The rumor you heard is absolutely not true if you&#039;re using a traditional HVAC system. There are some differences if you use a geo-thermal system in terms of recovery time, etc. I don&#039;t know about other types of systems other than forced air. It&#039;s common to recommend people set back their thermostats at night more than 5 degrees. 

Every winter night, we set our thermostat back 10 degrees for 8 hours.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aaron,

I&#039;m just stopping in to thank you for your blog. I received my nest 2.0 a couple months ago and truly love it. Lord knows I would have ended up with the 1.0 version with all its headaches if it were not for you!

Heard something that was alarming the other day, have you ever heard that it is bad for your furnace if you keep it off all day and then turn it on where it needs to catch up by more than 5 degrees?

Thanks again!]]></description>
