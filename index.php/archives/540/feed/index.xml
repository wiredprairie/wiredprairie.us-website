					<description><![CDATA[Moose -- I appreciate you leaving a comment here on my web site. I hope that you understand that your technique for &quot;protecting&quot; your images is hardly effective.   I&#039;ve seen some people use watermarks, but that distorts the beauty of a shot more often than not. Is it worth protecting a small picture to such great lengths?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the kind words and proof that my Paranoia is well founded. Here&#039;s a prime example of my image, that&#039;s right, a registered image having its copyright clearly and publicly violated and by a technique that shows clear intent of violation of that copyright in action. No mistake about it, you stole my image. Your impressive ten second grab could, if I wanted to push the button, cost you lots of money. That&#039;s not the point. I simply am tired of dealing with theft on a daily basis and want simply to share what is mine and have it remain mine. I don&#039;t take photos to lock them up on hard drives but to share. Why don&#039;t folks get that simple intent? Thanks for proving my paranoia, couldn&#039;t have done better job of it had I tried.
