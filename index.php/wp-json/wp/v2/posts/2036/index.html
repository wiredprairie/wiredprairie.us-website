(\u201c<em>Hey! You totally need a web site to drive more traffic!<\/em>\u201d). As you realize building web sites is not core to your business, you spend some hard earned income to invest $200 in a web site.<\/p>\n<p>To your untrained eye, you may not recognize the Microsoft FrontPage style template that $200 bought.<\/p>\n<p>Not only has the web designer created some static content, they\u2019ve thoughtfully created:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A blog<\/li>\n<li>An e-mail address<\/li>\n<li>A \u201cContact me\u201d form<\/li>\n<li>The Full Social-Package\u2122, including but not limited to: Twitter, Facebook Pages, Instagram, and Skype.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>After an all-too-brief explanation, you, sit back and wait for new business opportunities to arrive, <em>digitally.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>And nothing happens. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Maybe a blog post will help. So, you create the first (and last) blog post.<\/p>\n<p><em>And still nothing happens.<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So, business resumes as normal. The web site goes unmodified. The blog post remains, dull, and outdated.<\/p>\n<p>E-mails aren&#8217;t flooding in, so the e-mail address that was set up isn\u2019t checked frequently or at all.<\/p>\n<p>So, when a potential customer uses one of the social options or an email to contact your business, there is no timely response (if there&#8217;s one at all).<\/p>\n<p><strong>And then\u2026, you&#8217;ve lost a customer. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sorry, but I&#8217;m going to find a different business that meets my needs.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If a small business doesn\u2019t check and respond to voice mails once a (work) day, they may loose business. If that same business does not check their email, social accounts, MySpace pages, etc., they also may loose business.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure they meant well by having a web site with an email address, etc., but if it\u2019s not used, it\u2019s no different than not answering the phone.<\/p>\n<p>So, what happened? It started with <strong>unreasonable<\/strong> expectations.<\/p>\n<p>A blog, social-media accounts, email accounts, do not directly create new business opportunities. They are simply new channels for communication. It&#8217;s two-way. If your business doesn&#8217;t have a plan for these new forms of communication, they will fail.<\/p>\n<p>You will miss out on new customer opportunities. And <strong>worse,<\/strong> you may lose existing customers who may transition to using the other forms of communication you&#8217;ve claimed to offer. Spend an extra $100 to have a daily (or more frequently) plan developed to consistently use these communication options. Delete and remove any that don&#8217;t fit your business needs or that sit unused. If you don&#8217;t understand these forms of communication or how to integrate them effectively, there are lots of on line resources that can help, both paid and free.<\/p>\n<p>I like buying local and will support businesses that work best with my lifestyle and communication preferences.<\/p>\n<p>Small business owners can do better.
