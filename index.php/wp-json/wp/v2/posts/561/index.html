Microsoft is betting big on it. Can it become the definitive development platform for Microsoft? This software architect and developer certainly hopes <strong>NOT<\/strong>. SharePoint may be good for some enterprises. However, the user experience, the IT experience, and the current licensing models (server + client access licenses for all users) make any massive adoption unlikely. The licensing however can&#8217;t change much &#8212; otherwise there&#8217;s little point in betting big on SharePoint unless they can continue to make a significant amount of revenue from the platform in some other way. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"67\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/image26.png\" width=\"414\" border=\"0\"\/> <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"49\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/09\/image27.png\" width=\"358\" border=\"0\"\/> <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by the number of ISVs founded entirely on the SharePoint platform.
