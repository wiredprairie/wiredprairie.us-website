I&#8217;d looked at a lot of Dart code when it was first announced, but hadn&#8217;t looked at it much since. I couldn&#8217;t see it gaining meaningful traction against the JavaScript juggernaut as a transpiled option (as it added too much overhead from the complaints I&#8217;d read) and there was zero evidence that any company besides Google was considering integrating it as a native option for Web pages. Without broad industry cross-browser support (from desktop to mobile as well), it seemed like a dead-end option that didn&#8217;t add measurable value. In some ways it was doomed to fail as it was trying to be a better JavaScript rather than rethinking the whole client development experience. It was just a new web programming language.<\/p>\n<p>Originally, Dart&#8217;s messaging was broad and suggested that it was an ideal language for everywhere. That has changed since it&#8217;s original announcements to be focused on client development. But, that shift was recent and apparently connected with the announcement of Flutter.<\/p>\n<p>From November 1, 2011:<\/p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"2214\"

My initial impression is disappointment that the Flutter team is using Dart as it adds one more language to the client-side development sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord. I don&#8217;t know that the world needs another programming\/UI toolkit lock-in option right now added to the buffet. I like variety and competition, so I&#8217;m all for that, but I also worry that limited adoption of frameworks leads to abandonment and frustrated developers. I can speculate why they choose Dart, especially as it&#8217;s staffed by Google developers, and I can see the appeal of the language, but&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I don&#8217;t need more programming languages right now in my solutions toolbox<\/strong>. It&#8217;s one more thing to learn and master. Since Flutter is also new, it has made the initial ramp-up time longer than I&#8217;d expected and wanted.\u00a0 And because the language syntax is very familiar by design, it&#8217;s unfortunately likely that habits from other C-like and TypeScript-like will find their way into coding I do in Dart.<\/p>\n<p>While the community at large apparently considers the Widget building syntax to be a strength of Flutter, I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m excited about it. It&#8217;s chatty and verbose. (And I haven&#8217;t been able to tell if the enthusiasm about the current syntax is just from the early adopters or fans, or it&#8217;s generally well liked). It absolutely doesn&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s moving the needle when compared to all of the other GUI frameworks that have come before it.

This proposal brought out the best and worst of engineers of course. A few of the collaborators on Flutter were so dismissive of the idea I nearly stopped looking at Flutter.\u00a0 As Flutter is in its early days, and backed by Google, I expect ideas are rationally considered and individuals to be treated with respect, even if there is disagreement. I&#8217;ve done years of WPF, Silverlight, and UWP development which used XAML. While there continue to be some rough spots in XAML, I appreciated the structured document for building a UI. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d go in that direction for Flutter, but I don&#8217;t think describing complex user interfaces entirely in code is the best for its future viability, especially as it needs to compete with a variety of other frameworks and options.<\/p>\n<p>Ignoring the syntax of how to describe a UI though for a moment, I&#8217;m still having trouble with wrapping my head around the idea that State actually renders a UI:<\/p>\n<div class=\"oembed-gist\"><script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/wiredprairie\/1d23b8d168fd148cb1c6bfe8194984ce.js\"><\/script><noscript>View the code on <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/wiredprairie\/1d23b8d168fd148cb1c6bfe8194984ce\">Gist<\/a>.<\/noscript><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s the <strong>build<\/strong> method that returns the object hierarchy that describes the widget tree, not the class that subclasses <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.flutter.io\/flutter\/widgets\/StatefulWidget-class.html\"><strong>StatefulWidget<\/strong><\/a>.\u00a0 If you instead use a <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.flutter.io\/flutter\/widgets\/StatelessWidget-class.html\"><strong>StatelessWidget<\/strong><\/a>, it builds its Widget hierarchy directly within the class. I can see how they arrived at this implementation, but it just feels inconsistent.<\/p>\n<p>I like the <strong>async<\/strong>\/<strong>await<\/strong> support in Dart.

Unfortunately, Dart&#8217;s language is subtly different and I end up trying to use <strong>const\u00a0<\/strong>where I meant to use\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dartlang.org\/guides\/language\/language-tour#final-and-const\">final<\/a>.\u00a0<\/strong>That&#8217;s my problem of course, but it&#8217;s just a gotcha. <strong>Const<\/strong> in Dart is for compile-time constants.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been generally pleased with using Android Studio with the Flutter plugin. It performs reasonably well, and it&#8217;s a good editor with lots of bells and whistles. The build\/debug times are quite long, even for a basic app. It&#8217;s about 25-30 seconds for a build and deploy to an emulator. Thankfully, the plugin and Flutter both support hot reloading, so many changes to the code can be updated without needing to do a new build\/deploy. While that&#8217;s very helpful, I&#8217;d like to see a significantly reduced build and deploy time.<\/p>\n<p>In a market saturated with options for building cross-platform application UIs, it&#8217;s not clear how Flutter fits in. I&#8217;ve liked the experience enough that I&#8217;m going to build out a few simple apps and will show off more details in a later post of an app I&#8217;ve been tinkering with as I learn the platform and development environment. Flutter is in an &#8220;alpha&#8221; state right now, so a lot could change before it&#8217;s available in a final release (if it ever is). According to their\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/flutter\/flutter\/milestone\/21\">Github<\/a> repository, they have currently 86 issues open for their &#8220;beta&#8221; milestone.
