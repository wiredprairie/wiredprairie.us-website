I swapped one of the thermostats with a thermostat from a different floor in our house and then monitored the results over the weekend. I noticed the same problem in the new location: the thermostat would regularly read a temperature that was 3 to 4 degrees warmer than the actual room temperature. As it doesn\u2019t consistently exhibit the problem, it makes heating a room to a comfortable temperature somewhat challenging (and now that it\u2019s 19F outside, I\u2019d like it if it was a bit more on the mark).<\/p>\n<p>I spoke again with the same support engineer from Nest today (Mark). He called back as promised at the telephone number I left with him. He agreed that it was the thermostat that had a problem and decided to ship me a new one immediately (overnight). As today was an \u201cobserved\u201d holiday for most shipping companies in the USA, the new thermostat won\u2019t ship till tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p><em>Interesting tidbit is that the base of the device apparently has a serial number that is tied to the display and that they both must be returned at the same time when shipping a defective unit back to Nest.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"20111218-IMG_0136\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/20111218-IMG_0136_thumb.jpg\" width=\"259\" height=\"197\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When I arrived home this evening, my wife and I did our normal patterns. Go here, drop stuff off, etc. One of the places my wife walks nearly every evening takes her right by the Nest thermostat in a hallway on our first floor.<\/p>\n<p>As we were sitting down for dinner about 30 minutes later I noted that the temperature seemed a bit cooler than normal in the kitchen so I walked over to the thermostat. \u201cAuto away\u201d had been activated. <strong>Arrgh<\/strong>. What\u2019s odd (and annoying) is that the temperature should have been going to 69F starting at 5pm. At some point, it had decided that we were \u201caway\u201d and had never arrived home (I checked all of the schedules and everything seemed normal). I thought that there was some way to review the timings and choices it makes for that setting, but the \u201cEnergy\u201d option on the thermostat reported \u201cNo data\u201d for any of the recent days (I would have expected at least one day as I had moved the thermostat two days earlier).<\/p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE: Jan, 4, 2012: <\/strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00\">Ok the above happened AGAIN<\/span>. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019d want AUTO AWAY to also DEACTIVATE the schedule? Seriously? Turn off learning. Turn off Auto-away. What\u2019s left Nest?<\/p>\n<p>So, I don\u2019t know what to make of this new \u201cfeature.\u201d Clearly, we were in the house and the auto away should have been deactivated by our presence (I thought?). We did not activate \u201caway\u201d mode manually either.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/image.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/01\/image_thumb.png\" width=\"339\" height=\"354\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I definitely can\u2019t give high marks to this product and wouldn\u2019t recommend it right now.
