Although my phone finally supports 3G in those areas of the country that have 3G service &#8212; I&#8217;d hardly say that my Windows Mobile 6 phone web browsing experience is anything but barely adequate. I was never bothered by AT&amp;T EDGE speeds &#8212; mainly because the web pages rendered so poorly as to be barely useable. I don&#8217;t fault web sites for not considering my use to be a prime candidate for optimization and development. It&#8217;s a lot of work just to make a web page work on the various full-sized browsers such as IE, Firefox, and Safari. Then, they must consider the actual frequency of mobile users &#8212; near 0.1% I&#8217;m sure before deciding to create an optimized mobile web version. <\/p>\n<p>Amazon has a <a href=\"http:\/\/m.amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\">mobile<\/a> site though &#8212; and it&#8217;s perfect for my needs. Fast, simple, and renders perfectly. The other day in a local store, I did some price comparison&#8217;s with Amazon to verify that I should buy some of the stuff locally and wait to buy a few items when I got home from Amazon (I didn&#8217;t feel the need to try to buy something from Amazon while in a physical store). <\/p>\n<p>I frequently use mobile versions of news (CNN, MSNBC), weather (weather.com), and Google Reader.<\/p>\n<p>Why do we still need mobile then? <\/p>\n<p>I hear people talking about the ideal experience that is available on the iPhone\/iPod touch for browsing the web. I&#8217;m using a beta of SkyFire which attempts to emulate some of the experience of the iPhone browser on my WM6 phone. It&#8217;s not bad &#8212; but what I really don&#8217;t care for is all the zooming in and out and panning. It&#8217;s slow and sloppy. I&#8217;m disappointed when I need to use it. It&#8217;s solving a problem that we ideally shouldn&#8217;t have to deal with.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d be skeptical that you&#8217;d ever find a piece of PC\/Mac software that emulated that zooming and panning experience on your monitor\/LCD and enjoy it (imagine if your current web browser worked that way). (<em>And no, mapping software doesn&#8217;t count!<\/em>) Instead, you&#8217;d want something optimized for the computer and display. Lots of the better web designers and web sites get this and create optimized web sites for phones (I&#8217;ve seen mention of quite a few for the iPhone for example). I for one, hope they continue and don&#8217;t declare mobile web to be dead. For most applications, it&#8217;s a reasonable experience that is zero-install and &quot;good enough.&quot; It also targets the most phones &#8212; whereas doing custom development for the various phone platforms takes time, effort, etc. <\/p>\n<p>Do you have a data plan? Do you use your mobile phone&#8217;s web browser? What are your thoughts?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Geesh &#8212; one company dies and industry pundits (here for example) are declaring that the mobile web is finally dead.
