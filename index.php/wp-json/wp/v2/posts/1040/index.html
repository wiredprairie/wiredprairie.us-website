On that I agree with Mr. Jobs.

I really like the Flex framework and what AIR has done for the development community. And seriously, when is the last time you saw a really good HTML4\/5 game? It\u2019s still too hard to build things like that in pure HTML.) <\/p>\n<p>Do not however choose the completely proprietary and closed system that exists for Apple mobile products using XCode and Objective-C. It\u2019s a dead end from a portability perspective (especially after Apple banned portability platforms). <\/p>\n<p>What do you do if you need lower-level access to things that aren\u2019t available thru the HTML layer? Ask Steve about that apparently. <strong>It\u2019s magical \u2013 so either it\u2019s there, or you apparently didn\u2019t need it.&#160; <\/strong>(I\u2019d actually consider creating a native app in this case and wrapping the browser and making it a blended experience with as little in the native application as possible).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty simple to create a manifest file for your web application so users can add it to the iPhone experience as a icon that will act like any other iPhone application (you can even hide the \u201csafari\u201d chrome).&#160; <\/p>\n<p>By creating a mobile web application, it will be accessible on many phone and new device platform categories (maybe like the new webkit powered TomTom GPS for example). <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steve Jobs certainly makes me want to check out the magic that is apparently HTML5.
