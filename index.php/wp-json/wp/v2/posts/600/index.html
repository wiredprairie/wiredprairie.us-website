So, I compared it\u2019s size against my current favorite, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/index.php\/photography\">Canon Powershot 870<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/image15.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"237\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>(The Canon is on the left, Panasonic on right).<\/p>\n<p>So, the Panasonic would be a bit bigger, but it would probably fit in my jeans pocket. However, there were three things that kept me from jumping and buying the Panasonic:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lens cap<\/strong>. Like a DSLR, it has a lens cap that must be managed. There\u2019s a little \u201ctie\u201d of some sort that it ships with, but I like the convenience of not worrying about extra pieces when I\u2019m carrying a point and shoot camera.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Zoom<\/strong>. A sad 2.5x zoom. I can\u2019t always use my feet to get me closer to things \u2013 so zoom comes in handy. 2.5 is really sad.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Proprietary RAW. <\/strong>There\u2019s no indication that Adobe will support this custom RAW format any time soon. I like Lightroom 2.1 \u2026 I don\u2019t want to use more than one tool to process my images. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The image quality, from what I\u2019ve read is pretty good on the LX3. Better than a lot of cameras before it. The low light handling is also good (from what I\u2019ve read).<\/p>\n<p>The Canon, although the G9 was well rated, is just too big and heavy for the point and shoot style camera I\u2019m looking for.<\/p>\n<p>Then there was the Nikon \u2026 cool that it had built in GPS, (yet I read some people suggested it drained the battery too quickly and wasn\u2019t as accurate as other GPS chips \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.nelso.com%2F2008%2F10%2Ftesting-gps-in-nikon-coolpix-p6000.html&amp;ei=HicBSbrfG4_svAW_oPj1DQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIGWTHJCT5-c2ZFev_0sf9l_nTpg&amp;sig2=8pHS_8GqTOM0oM00-9PBUw\">here for example<\/a>), it was a bit bigger than I would like. The RAW support, although more proprietary than the preview RAW formats released by Nikon cameras (NEF), is supported by Lightroom.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, I decided not to buy any of these for now \u2013 and I\u2019d rather wait for something that doesn\u2019t have as many compromises for me. I bet they all will take great pictures \u2013 and if your needs are slightly different than mine, you\u2019d likely be very happy. (If you don\u2019t have a desire to carry the camera in a pants pocket\u2026.)<\/p>\n<p>What did I do instead? I bought a new vibration reduction telephoto zoom lens for my D300! :) <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" align=\"left\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/10\/image16.png\" width=\"123\" height=\"142\" \/>I bought the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bhphotovideo.com\/c\/product\/581247-REG\/Tamron_AFB003NII_700_18_270mm_f_3_5_6_3_Di_II_VC.html?BI=2907&amp;KW=&amp;KBID=3842\">Tamron 18-270mm f\/3.5-6.3 Di-II VC LD Asph. Macro Lens<\/a>. It\u2019s a 72mm 3.5-22\/6.3-40 f\/Stop lens with great wide-angle to awesome zoom abilities in a very compact lens. I own the 18-250 (no vibration reduction), which I\u2019ve taken many thousands of photos with and been <strong>extremely happy <\/strong>with the high quality images. So, I had no reason to doubt that this lens would be equally good for my needs. I could have bought the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bhphotovideo.com\/c\/product\/408518-USA\/Nikon_2159_18_200mm_f_3_5_5_6G_ED_IF_AF_S.html?BI=2907&amp;KW=&amp;KBID=3842\">Nikon 18-200<\/a>, but the Tamron is a bit cheaper, has a better zoom range, and the brand has proven it\u2019s capable of good things. <\/p>\n<p>Both lens are about the same length and weight \u2013 so I couldn\u2019t see any reason not to go with the slightly more capable lens. I\u2019m not a professional photographer and I don\u2019t have expectations that a $600 lens will be of the same quality as a $5000 lens (unlike some people in forums who seem to expect that). <\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have any shots I can post yet from the Tamron 18-270mm, but when I do, I\u2019ll be sure to link to them (they\u2019ll be on my SmugMug page). <\/p>\n<p>&#160; <\/p>\n<p>&#160; <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bhphotovideo.com?BI=2907&amp;KW=BANNER2&amp;KBID=3842&amp;img=bh_broad_scope_170x142.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http:\/\/www.bhphotovideo.com\/images\/affiliateimages\/bh_broad_scope_170x142.jpg\" \/><\/a> <img border=\"0\" src=\"http:\/\/affiliates.bhphotovideo.com\/showban.asp?id=3842&amp;img=bh_broad_scope_170x142.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My wife and I are doing a bit of international travel soon and I had decided that I\u2019d buy a new point and shoot camera to take with me.
