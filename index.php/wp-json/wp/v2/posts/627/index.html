I\u2019ve owned that lens since I bought my D300. To set expectations regarding my photography skills and tools, you might want to head to my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/index.php\/photography\">photography<\/a> page on my web site which lists most of my current equipment. I\u2019d definitely describe myself as an amateur with a very forgiving wife (married, with expensive hobby, \u2026 get it? :) ). I was very happy with the 18-250mm. I\u2019ve taken a bunch of photos that I\u2019m really happy with and it\u2019s more than met my expectations. The only downside was that it didn\u2019t have vibration reduction. There have been too many events and outings recently that I really wish I had a bit more freedom to take photos without a tripod. <\/p>\n<p>I knew Paris would be a great test as we\u2019d be indoors in museums and such just as much as we\u2019d be outdoors, and it was predicted to be gloomy and rainy all the days we were scheduled to be there. Although it thankfully rained almost entirely during the early morning hours (while sleeping), it was gloomy nearly every day. <\/p>\n<p>Overall, I really think the lens rocked. The only problems I occasionally would mumble about was having difficultly locking focus. It wasn\u2019t frequent, and usually was related to some unusual shot I was trying to take. Either it would eventually lock, or I\u2019d change the focal length slightly and it would lock immediately. A few times, I focused manually. I took about 800 photographs while in Paris \u2013- and only a small number of shots overall were delayed by this issue. I can\u2019t honestly say that my older Tamron had the problem \u2013 not very often. However, I\u2019m not sure that I would have expected the end shot to be as nice in many of the situations given the likely blurred shots that would have resulted from me handholding in such low light situations. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/wiredprairie.smugmug.com\/gallery\/6593608_CuvJX\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 10px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" align=\"right\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/11\/image16.png\" width=\"220\" height=\"181\" \/><\/a> <\/p>\n<p>I could also tell that the lens weighed more than my old lens. After long days carrying around the camera, my SmugMug :) neck strap wasn\u2019t sufficient. <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen some complaints of lens creep &#8212; (where the lens will slowly open when tilted downward on its own if the lock is not set). I\u2019ve had lenses that do this \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty common actually given how these super zoom lenses need to work. You can lock it completely at the widest setting to prevent it with a small lock on the side of the lens. I haven\u2019t had the problem with this lens (yet). When the creeps start to happen, it\u2019s annoying, but I\u2019ve gotten over it in the past. <\/p>\n<p>The Tamron lenses are not for full-frame sensor cameras like the D700. <\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, and to understand my feelings on this \u2013 <strong>this is not a professional lens<\/strong>. I did not pay a professional lens price. I do not expect professional lens quality. Far too many reviewers of lenses seem to expect that even though they paid 1\/10 the cost of a lens (or camera body, or etc.), it should have the characteristics and quality of the more expensive items. I don\u2019t believe that for a second. You often get what you paid for. Lenses are no different. <\/p>\n<p>Given that and the few problems I had, I\u2019d definitely recommend this lens for around $600. Of course, buy from somewhere reputable, and check into return policies if you\u2019re not sure. The lens has a 6-year warranty from the manufacturer.&#160; <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve uploaded the full size images (converted from RAW) for you to look at on SmugMug <a href=\"http:\/\/wiredprairie.smugmug.com\/gallery\/6593608_CuvJX\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>More information:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bhphotovideo.com\/c\/product\/581247-REG\/Tamron_AFB003NII_700_18_270mm_f_3_5_6_3_Di_II_VC.html?BI=2907&amp;KW=&amp;KBID=3842\">B&amp;H<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B001DYC0CS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wiredp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001DYC0CS\">Amazon<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tamron.com\/B003special\/index.html\">Manufacturer\u2019s Page<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently purchased a Tamron 18-270mm f\/3.5-6.3 Di II VC LD Aspherical IF Macro Lens (for my Nikon D300).
