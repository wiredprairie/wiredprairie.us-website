I tried replacing it with a tiny transparent image, but I was denied \u2026, as it requires an image at least 800&#215;600. So, I tried a white 800&#215;600 image:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/image3.png\" width=\"297\" height=\"214\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>Weak though. I liked the fact that the image was tiny (around 600 bytes), but it\u2019s too washed out. Apparently, Google doesn\u2019t have an algorithm that can make a smart decision about text contrast and the photo being used. Too bad.<\/p>\n<p>So, I tried a black image:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/image4.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"214\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>Not too bad. Passable. <\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d prefer however an option to switch back to the simple white background. The default background image today is absolutely awful (IMHO). I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only person this morning shocked by the change.<\/p>\n<p>This option is such a tease:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px\" title=\"image\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/image5.png\" width=\"173\" height=\"45\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>As it just removes an image you selected, and switches back to the default image. :-P<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like the black background I use as a temporary fix\u2026, just click on the black rectangle below, which should open the original file.
