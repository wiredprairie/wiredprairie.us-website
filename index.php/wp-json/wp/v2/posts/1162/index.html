Silverlight also has some \u201csweet spots\u201d in media and line-of-business applications, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#160;<\/p>\n<p>But when it comes to touting Silverlight as Microsoft\u2019s vehicle for delivering a cross-platform runtime, \u201cour strategy has shifted,\u201d Muglia told me.<\/p>\n<p>&#160;<\/p>\n<p>Silverlight will continue to be a cross-platform solution, working on a variety of operating system\/browser platforms, going forward, he said. \u201cBut HTML is the only true cross platform solution for everything, including (Apple\u2019s) iOS platform,\u201d Muglia said.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>OK, so many who read this read a lot between the lines. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2010\/10\/30\/rip-silverlight-on-the-web\/\">Microsoft Has Seen The Light. And It\u2019s Not Silverlight.<\/a> <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Whatever HTML5 means to you (and your definition is likely different than mine unfortunately), it can\u2019t do everything. There\u2019s still a place for Silverlight and Flash in this world. Many consumer facing web sites, simply don\u2019t need Flash or Silverlight. Either of these browser plug-ins can enhance the consumer experience, but rarely are they needed for the average web site. You won\u2019t likely see more Flash or Silverlight on traditional consumer facing web sites.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, BobMu <a href=\"http:\/\/team.silverlight.net\/announcement\/pdc-and-silverlight\/\">responded<\/a> and tried to calm some fears (which was only somewhat effective).<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d consider there are a few places where HTML (4+) is not yet rich enough to provide the type of experience demanded by users:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Games<\/strong>. JavaScript and HTML just isn\u2019t yet up to the task of creating a good rich game. It\u2019s not really the platform\u2019s fault \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t designed with it in mind. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Business Applications. <\/strong>It\u2019s great that Twitter can run completely in the web browser or that you\u2019re able to enter a street address to collect a consumer\u2019s home shipping address for a package (with the ability to provide some text hinting as a bonus). But, business applications are far more complex, and require robust data and input handling that are very challenging to handle, especially cross browser. Layout of complex data (tables or not) can be maddening and extremely inefficient in browsers, when data needs to be truncated, formatted, centered, sorted, etc.\n<p>It\u2019s easy to build a ineffective web application in HTML that doesn\u2019t consider the user. Too easy. That\u2019s where the plug-ins can excel when used properly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Many things can be hacked to work in the web browser without Silverlight. However, this comes at a great cost of development and maintenance and QA. How many times have you written a web application and not needed to fix an issue that happens only in one browser (and worse, only in a particular version)? If you haven\u2019t, it\u2019s likely you haven\u2019t written a complex web application or that your needs are very simple. <\/p>\n<p>This is where Silverlight (and Flash\/Flex) both shine. They provide a consistent and robust user experience across supported browsers and platforms. Write it once, and it really should run nearly anywhere the plug-ins are supported without issue. Furthermore, they both provide a better debugging and development experience than JavaScript\/HTML. <\/p>\n<p>Even though Silverlight and Flex are best used in Enterprise development, I worry that Microsoft may still abandon the platform sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft totally missed the boat on Silverlight for games. If they had gotten a better foothold in that market, I\u2019d be much less worried. I\u2019ve never encountered a game that was written in Silverlight that wasn\u2019t pointed by some Silverlight blog I follow. Flash I encounter all the time. Silverlight should be a decent gaming platform, but the development and design tools for gaming in Silverlight <strong>suck<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>in comparison to those provided by Flash. <strong>Suck<\/strong>. There\u2019s no real consideration for the type of animation and character creation that the Flash tools provide that game development shops need.<\/p>\n<p>Blend \u2013 phhpt. Don\u2019t get me started on how awful that would be to use as an animator. Expression Design? <strong>Ha!<\/strong> That thing is a joke compared to Flash CS5. At best, an animator could painfully create illustrations in Photoshop or Illustrator and then import them as layers into Blend, and then try to manage them \u2026 yuck. Too many tools and not enough interaction between them. <\/p>\n<p>This is a new game that demonstrated at Adobe Max \u2013 beautifully done. It\u2019s using Flash. I can\u2019t imagine it being done in any other platform today.<\/p>\n<p><object width=\"480\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/zvGJ9FRt2y4?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><\/object><\/p>\n<p>So, that leaves business applications as the other major distinguishing feature of these plug-ins. <\/p>\n<p>But, will that be enough?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s absolutely enough to keep them alive for another 3-5 years without any issues. Even once HTML5 settles into place and the major 3 or 4 browsers implement most of the features, there still will be a lack of good support for typical business applications. Again, it\u2019s just not something HTML 5 was built for. It would require enhancements. HTML 6 maybe? <\/p>\n<p>Eventually, browsers will support the typical enterprise web application needs. It\u2019s at that point that the Flash and Silverlight\u2019s we know of today will be retired. But, neither Microsoft or Adobe is going to sit idly by and watch their platforms die a slow miserable death. Both sell tools. That\u2019s how they make money. The plug-ins generate no real money. It\u2019s the tools. Once the tools stop being profitable, the technologies will be retired or open sourced. For the sake of enterprise development shops, one could hope for the latter (but my guess is that intellectual property issues surrounding much of the plug-in will make this impractical, especially video\/audio codecs.).<\/p>\n<p>The best chance for both Adobe and Microsoft seems to be in the application market. Not a pure web application delivered via the browser, but an out-of-the-browser application. Adobe AIR and Silverlight both provide a reasonably robust (and continuously improving) out of the browser experience that in some ways exceeds the native platform capabilities in terms of developer and designer productivity. Both allow developers to be far more productive than the equivalent HTML\/JavaScript solution of reasonable complexity.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, both are cross platform (Mac OS X and Windows). That\u2019s a huge win for both companies. Although some predict that the rise of \u201ctablets\/pads\u201d prove that the end is near for personal computers, Apple\u2019s recent Macbook Air (2010) debut shows the opposite. It\u2019s a slick lightweight laptop. (There are some Win7 notebooks that have similar characteristics). The keyboard is not dead. Giant 8 pound laptops are hopefully dead (except for those who want a \u201cdesktop replacement.\u201d The traditional PC tower may be going away for many <u>consumers<\/u>, but typing and mouse driven interaction isn\u2019t going away any time soon (and laptops aren\u2019t generally very cheap or effective in an enterprise, especially where mobility isn\u2019t important). You may be able to casually browse the web for a couple of hours (?!) on a touch screen tablet (like the iPad), but could you do data entry? Not for very long before you wanted to toss it out the window, or, attach a keyboard. <\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s still a place for many different form factors. As long as there are sufficient business enterprises in need of rich interactive applications, delivered over the web, using web services, there will be a place for Silverlight and Adobe\u2019s Flash. When the time comes and they aren\u2019t necessary anymore, it will be time to port and convert. Microsoft and Adobe won\u2019t want to abandon you in that case either as they\u2019ll want to provide new tools to help you move to the next \u201cweb platform.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Eventually, Microsoft will announce, \u201cSilverlight is being retired. We will support it for the next 3 years.\u201d At that point, you may start the panic. For now though, continue on as usual. Always pick a solution based on the product. Don\u2019t use Silverlight just because you think it\u2019s more fun than HTML. Pick the right tool for the job.<\/p>\n<p>As I said, it will happen. HTML 5 and its friends have accelerated its end, but it\u2019s not happening so soon you should be considering throwing out all of your Silverlight books. Keep them.
