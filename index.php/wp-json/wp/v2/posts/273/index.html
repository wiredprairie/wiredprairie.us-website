Oh, I know, I know, I&#8217;m sure there are lots of things WPF may be able to do that Flash can&#8217;t &#8230; but I&#8217;m more interested in the practical, get your job done things here, so I&#8217;ll suggest that the parity is more of a practical\/useful feature set match than a specific side-by-side comparison.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>3D Effects<\/strong> &#8211; Easily transform and animate any display object through 3D space while retaining full interactivity.&nbsp; Fast, lightweight, and native 3D effects make motion that was previously reserved for expert users available to everyone.&nbsp; Complex effects are simple with APIs that extend what you already know.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>It looks like it&#8217;s easier to do 3D in Flash 10 than it is in WPF by an order of magnitude. Again, practical 3D &#8230; not necessarily your 3D for doing a live rendering of a heart &#8212; but interactive 3D that could be useful in many applications (as shown in one of the videos).<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Visual Performance Improvements<\/strong> \u2013 Applications and videos will run smoother and faster with expanded use of hardware acceleration.&nbsp; By moving several visual processing tasks to the video card, the CPU is free to do more.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Hmm&#8230; remind you of the &#8220;big&#8221; feature of WPF &#8212; offloading its work to the GPU? It&#8217;s coming in Flash. <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><u>GPU Compositing<\/u> \u2014 Combining images, filters, and video in your SWF just got faster.&nbsp; Your video card can be used to do compositing on all raster content.&nbsp; Utilizing the hardware processing power of the graphics card, GPU compositing accelerates compositing calculations of bitmaps, filters, blend modes, and video overlays faster than would be performed in software on the CPU.&nbsp; GPU compositing is applied when specified in the HTML parameters provided appropriate graphics hardware is available.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>And, the little things&#8230;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><u>Context Menu<\/u> \u2014 Developers now have more control over what can be displayed in the context menu through the use of ActionScript APIs for common text field context menu items, supporting plain and rich text. The clipboard menu provides access to the clipboard in a safe and controlled way, and you can write handlers to paste text.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>You can watch a bunch of demos <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.adobe.com\/technologies\/flashplayer10\/demos\/#videos\">here<\/a> (you only need Flash 9 installed to watch the videos).<\/p>\n<p>Easy 3D:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"273\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/05\/image17.png\" width=\"450\" border=\"0\"\/> <\/p>\n<p>Filters and effects (live with Video support):<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"306\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/05\/image18.png\" width=\"450\" border=\"0\"\/> <\/p>\n<p>Improved Text Rendering&#8230; (ligatures are used in the video).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/05\/image19.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"159\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wiredprairie.us\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/05\/image-thumb17.png\" width=\"240\" border=\"0\"\/><\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Microsoft: what&#8217;s in the box for Silverlight 3.0?
